# List of directories/files that we ignore for the AUTOSEL and the "Fixes tag
# only" tools.
#
# If anything matches in these directories/files, they will not be picked up by
# these tools, but rather they MUST have a "Cc: stable@" tag in the
# signed-off-by area of the commit log, as per the rules in
# Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst in the kernel source tree, in
# order for them to be picked for any stable release automatically.
