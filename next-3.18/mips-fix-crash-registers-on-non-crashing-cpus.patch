Subject: MIPS: Fix crash registers on non-crashing CPUs

From: Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

commit c80e1b62ffca52e2d1d865ee58bc79c4c0c55005 upstream.

As part of handling a crash on an SMP system, an IPI is send to
all other CPUs to save their current registers and stop.  It was
using task_pt_regs(current) to get the registers, but that will
only be accurate if the CPU was interrupted running in userland.
Instead allow the architecture to pass in the registers (all
pass NULL now, but allow for the future) and then use get_irq_regs()
which should be accurate as we are in an interrupt.  Fall back to
task_pt_regs(current) if nothing else is available.
