Subject: net_sched: close another race condition in tcf_mirred_release()

From: WANG Cong <xiyou.wangcong@gmail.com>

commit dc327f8931cb9d66191f489eb9a852fc04530546 upstream.

We saw the following extra refcount release on veth device:

  kernel: [7957821.463992] unregister_netdevice: waiting for mesos50284 to become free. Usage count = -1

Since we heavily use mirred action to redirect packets to veth, I think
this is caused by the following race condition:

CPU0:
tcf_mirred_release(): (in RCU callback)
	struct net_device *dev = rcu_dereference_protected(m->tcfm_dev, 1);

CPU1:
mirred_device_event():
        spin_lock_bh(&mirred_list_lock);
        list_for_each_entry(m, &mirred_list, tcfm_list) {
                if (rcu_access_pointer(m->tcfm_dev) == dev) {
                        dev_put(dev);
                        /* Note : no rcu grace period necessary, as
                         * net_device are already rcu protected.
                         */
                        RCU_INIT_POINTER(m->tcfm_dev, NULL);
                }
        }
        spin_unlock_bh(&mirred_list_lock);

CPU0:
tcf_mirred_release():
        spin_lock_bh(&mirred_list_lock);
        list_del(&m->tcfm_list);
        spin_unlock_bh(&mirred_list_lock);
        if (dev)               // <======== Stil refers to the old m->tcfm_dev
                dev_put(dev);  // <======== dev_put() is called on it again

The action init code path is good because it is impossible to modify
an action that is being removed.

So, fix this by moving everything under the spinlock.

Fixes: 6bd00b850635 ("act_mirred: fix a race condition on mirred_list")
