Subject: ALSA: hda/hdmi: Add HP Device 0x8711 to force connect list

From: Jiao Zhou <jiaozhou@google.com>

commit 31b573946ea55e1ea0e08ae8e83bcf879b30f83a upstream.

HDMI audio is not working on the HP EliteDesk 800 G6 because the pin is
unconnected. This issue can be resolved by using the 'hdajackretask'
tool to override the unconnected pin to force it to connect.
