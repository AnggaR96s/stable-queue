Subject: objtool: sync up with the 4.14.47 version of objtool

There are pros and cons of dealing with tools in the kernel directory.
The pros are the fact that development happens fast, and new features
can be added to the kernel and the tools at the same times.  The cons
are when dealing with backported kernel patches, it can be necessary to
backport parts of the tool changes as well.

For 4.9.y so far, we have backported individual patches.  That quickly
breaks down when there are minor differences between how backports were
handled, so grabbing 40+ patch long series can be difficult, not
impossible, but really frustrating to attempt.

To help mitigate this mess, here's a single big patch to sync up the
objtool logic to the 4.14.47 version of the tool.  From this point
forward (after some other minor header file patches are applied), the
tool should be in sync and much easier to maintain over time.

This has survivied my limited testing, and as the codebase is identical
to 4.14.47, I'm pretty comfortable dropping this big change in here in
4.9.y.  Hopefully all goes well...

-   As an alternative to frame pointers, DWARF Call Frame Information
-   (CFI) metadata can be used to walk the stack.  Unlike frame pointers,
-   CFI metadata is out of band.  So it doesn't affect runtime
-   performance and it can be reliable even when interrupts or exceptions
-   are involved.
-
-   For C code, gcc automatically generates DWARF CFI metadata.  But for
-   asm code, generating CFI is a tedious manual approach which requires
-   manually placed .cfi assembler macros to be scattered throughout the
-   code.  It's clumsy and very easy to get wrong, and it makes the real
-   code harder to read.
-
-   Stacktool will improve this situation in several ways.  For code
-   which already has CFI annotations, it will validate them.  For code
-   which doesn't have CFI annotations, it will generate them.  So an
-   architecture can opt to strip out all the manual .cfi annotations
-   from their asm code and have objtool generate them instead.
-
-   We might also add a runtime stack validation debug option where we
-   periodically walk the stack from schedule() and/or an NMI to ensure
-   that the stack metadata is sane and that we reach the bottom of the
-   stack.
-
-   So the benefit of objtool here will be that external tooling should
-   always show perfect stack traces.  And the same will be true for
-   kernel warning/oops traces if the architecture has a runtime DWARF
-   unwinder.

 c) Higher live patching compatibility rate
 
-   (NOTE: This is not yet implemented)
-
-   Currently with CONFIG_LIVEPATCH there's a basic live patching
-   framework which is safe for roughly 85-90% of "security" fixes.  But
-   patches can't have complex features like function dependency or
-   prototype changes, or data structure changes.
-
-   There's a strong need to support patches which have the more complex
-   features so that the patch compatibility rate for security fixes can
-   eventually approach something resembling 100%.  To achieve that, a
-   "consistency model" is needed, which allows tasks to be safely
-   transitioned from an unpatched state to a patched state.
-
-   One of the key requirements of the currently proposed livepatch
-   consistency model [*] is that it needs to walk the stack of each
-   sleeping task to determine if it can be transitioned to the patched
-   state.  If objtool can ensure that stack traces are reliable, this
-   consistency model can be used and the live patching compatibility
-   rate can be improved significantly.

-2. asm_file.o: warning: objtool: .text+0x53: return instruction outside of a callable function
+   If the error is for an asm file, and func() is indeed a callable
+   function, add proper frame pointer logic using the FRAME_BEGIN and
+   FRAME_END macros.  Otherwise, if it's not a callable function, remove
+   its ELF function annotation by changing ENDPROC to END, and instead
+   use the manual unwind hint macros in asm/unwind_hints.h.
+
+   If it's a GCC-compiled .c file, the error may be because the function
+   uses an inline asm() statement which has a "call" instruction.  An
+   asm() statement with a call instruction must declare the use of the
+   stack pointer in its output operand.  On x86_64, this means adding
+   the ASM_CALL_CONSTRAINT as an output constraint:
 
-   A return instruction was detected, but objtool couldn't find a way
-   for a callable function to reach the instruction.
+     asm volatile("call func" : ASM_CALL_CONSTRAINT);
 
-   If the return instruction is inside (or reachable from) a callable
-   function, the function needs to be annotated with the ENTRY/ENDPROC
-   macros.
-
-   If you _really_ need a return instruction outside of a function, and
-   are 100% sure that it won't affect stack traces, you can tell
-   objtool to ignore it.  See the "Adding exceptions" section below.

-   If the instruction is actually needed, and it's actually in a
-   callable function, ensure that its function is properly annotated
-   with ENTRY/ENDPROC.
+   If the error is for an asm file, and the instruction is inside (or

+   Otherwise, the code should probably be annotated with the unwind hint
+   macros in asm/unwind_hints.h so objtool and the unwinder can know the
+   stack state associated with the code.

    The instruction's frame pointer state is inconsistent, depending on
    which execution path was taken to reach the instruction.
 
-   Make sure the function pushes and sets up the frame pointer (for
-   x86_64, this means rbp) at the beginning of the function and pops it
-   at the end of the function.  Also make sure that no other code in the

       might be corrupt due to a gcc bug.  For more details, see:
       https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70646
 
-2. If you're getting any other objtool error in a compiled .c file, it
-   may be because the file uses an asm() statement which has a "call"
-   instruction.  An asm() statement with a call instruction must declare
-   the use of the stack pointer in its output operand.  For example, on
-   x86_64:
-
-     register void *__sp asm("rsp");
-     asm volatile("call func" : "+r" (__sp));
-
-   Otherwise the stack frame may not get created before the call.
-
-3. Another possible cause for errors in C code is if the Makefile removes
-   -fno-omit-frame-pointer or adds -fomit-frame-pointer to the gcc options.
-
-Also see the above section for .S file errors for more information what
-the individual error messages mean.
 
 If the error doesn't seem to make sense, it could be a bug in objtool.
 Feel free to ask the objtool maintainer for help.
