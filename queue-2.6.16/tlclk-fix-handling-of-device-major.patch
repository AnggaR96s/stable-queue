Subject: tlclk: fix handling of device major


From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>

tlclk calls register_chrdev() and permits register_chrdev() to allocate the
major, but it promptly forgets what that major was.  So if there's no hardware
present you still get "telco_clock" appearing in /proc/devices and, I assume,
an oops reading /proc/devices if tlclk was a module.

Fix.

Mark, I'd suggest that that we not call register_chrdev() until _after_ we've
established that the hardware is present.
