Subject: [stable] [PATCH] Check bio address after mapping through partitions.

Partitions are not limited to live within a device.  So
we should range check after partition mapping.

Note that 'maxsector' was being used for two different things.  I have
split off the second usage into 'old_sector' so that maxsector can be
still be used for it's primary usage later in the function.
