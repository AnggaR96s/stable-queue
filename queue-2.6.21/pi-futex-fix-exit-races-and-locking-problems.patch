Subject: pi-futex: Fix exit races and locking problems


From: Alexey Kuznetsov <kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru>
1. New entries can be added to tsk->pi_state_list after task completed
   exit_pi_state_list(). The result is memory leakage and deadlocks.

2. handle_mm_fault() is called under spinlock. The result is obvious.

3. results in self-inflicted deadlock inside glibc.
   Sometimes futex_lock_pi returns -ESRCH, when it is not expected
   and glibc enters to for(;;) sleep() to simulate deadlock. This problem
   is quite obvious and I think the patch is right. Though it looks like
   each "if" in futex_lock_pi() got some stupid special case "else if". :-)

4. sometimes futex_lock_pi() returns -EDEADLK,
   when nobody has the lock. The reason is also obvious (see comment
   in the patch), but correct fix is far beyond my comprehension.
   I guess someone already saw this, the chunk:

                        if (rt_mutex_trylock(&q.pi_state->pi_mutex))
                                ret = 0;

   is obviously from the same opera. But it does not work, because the
   rtmutex is really taken at this point: wake_futex_pi() of previous
   owner reassigned it to us. My fix works. But it looks very stupid.
   I would think about removal of shift of ownership in wake_futex_pi()
   and making all the work in context of process taking lock.

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

Fix 1) Avoid the tasklist lock variant of the exit race fix by adding
    an additional state transition to the exit code.

    This fixes also the issue, when a task with recursive segfaults
    is not able to release the futexes.

Fix 2) Cleanup the lookup_pi_state() failure path and solve the -ESRCH
    problem finally.

Fix 3) Solve the fixup_pi_state_owner() problem which needs to do the fixup
    in the lock protected section by using the in_atomic userspace access
    functions.
	
    This removes also the ugly lock drop / unqueue inside of fixup_pi_state()

Fix 4) Fix a stale lock in the error path of futex_wake_pi()

Added some error checks for verification.

The -EDEADLK problem is solved by the rtmutex fixups.
