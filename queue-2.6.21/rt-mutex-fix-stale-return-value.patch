Subject: rt-mutex: Fix stale return value

Alexey Kuznetsov found some problems in the pi-futex code. 

The major problem is a stale return value in rt_mutex_slowlock():

When the pi chain walk returns -EDEADLK, but the waiter was woken up 
during the phases where the locks were dropped, the rtmutex could be
acquired, but due to the stale return value -EDEADLK returned to the
caller.

Reset the return value in the woken up path.
