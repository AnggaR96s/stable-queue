Subject: timer stats: speedups

Make timer-stats have almost zero overhead when enabled in the config but
not used.  (this way distros can enable it more easily)

Also update the documentation about overhead of timer_stats - it was
written for the first version which had a global lock and a linear list
walk based lookup ;-)

Andrew says:
And this.  Not a bugfix, but trivial and obvious and apparently some
distros don't want to enable timer_stats because of the performance
issue, but powertop uses timer_stats.

Ingo replies:
seconded. I have tested this with and without CONFIG_TIMER_STATS, with
and without timer_stats collection activated.

 timer_stats should be used by kernel and userspace developers to verify that
