Commit a491486a2087ac3dfc00efb4f838c8d684afaf54 introduced a locking
problem in JFFS2 -- we up() the alloc_sem when we weren't previously
holding it. This leads to all kinds of fun behaviour later.

There was a _reason_ for the
	if (1 /* alternative path needs testing */ ||
which the above-mentioned commit removed :)
