Subject: fuse: fix permission checking

[upstream commit 1a823ac9ff09cbdf39201df37b7ede1f9395de83]

I added a nasty local variable shadowing bug to fuse in 2.6.24, with the
result, that the 'default_permissions' mount option is basically ignored.

How did this happen?

 - old err declaration in inner scope
 - new err getting declared in outer scope
 - 'return err' from inner scope getting removed
 - old declaration not being noticed

-Wshadow would have saved us, but it doesn't seem practical for
the kernel :(

More testing would have also saved us :((
