Subject: hugetlb: ensure we do not reference a surplus page after handing it to buddy

From: Andy Whitcroft <apw@shadowen.org>
commit: e5df70ab194543522397fa3da8c8f80564a0f7d3

When we free a page via free_huge_page and we detect that we are in surplus
the page will be returned to the buddy.  After this we no longer own the page.

However at the end free_huge_page we clear out our mapping pointer from
page private.  Even where the page is not a surplus we free the page to
the hugepage pool, drop the pool locks and then clear page private.  In
either case the page may have been reallocated.  BAD.

Make sure we clear out page private before we free the page.
