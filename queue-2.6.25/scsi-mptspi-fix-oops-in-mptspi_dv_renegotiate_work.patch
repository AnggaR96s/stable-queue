Subject: SCSI: mptspi: fix oops in mptspi_dv_renegotiate_work()
To: jejb@kernel.org, stable@kernel.org
Message-ID: <200807122140.m6CLep0S009408@hera.kernel.org>

commit 081a5bcb39b455405d58f79bb3c9398a9d4477ed upstream

The problem here is that if the ioc faults too early in the bring up
sequence (as it usually does for an irq routing problem), ioc_reset gets
called before the scsi host is even allocated.  This causes an oops when
it later schedules a renegotiation.  Fix this by checking ioc->sh before
trying to renegotiate.
