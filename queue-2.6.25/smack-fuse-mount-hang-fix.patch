Subject: Smack: fuse mount hang fix

The d_instantiate hook for Smack can hang on the root inode of a
filesystem if the file system code has not really done all the set-up.
Fuse is known to encounter this problem.

This change detects an attempt to instantiate a root inode and addresses
it early in the processing, before any attempt is made to do something
that might hang.
