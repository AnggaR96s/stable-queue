Subject: x86, early_ioremap: fix fencepost error
To: jejb@kernel.org, stable@kernel.org
Message-ID: <200810121940.m9CJe8k3024539@hera.kernel.org>

From: Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>

commit c613ec1a7ff3714da11c7c48a13bab03beb5c376 upstream

The x86 implementation of early_ioremap has an off by one error. If we get
an object which ends on the first byte of a page we undermap by one page and
this causes a crash on boot with the ASUS P5QL whose DMI table happens to fit
this alignment.

The size computation is currently

	last_addr = phys_addr + size - 1;
	npages = (PAGE_ALIGN(last_addr) - phys_addr)

(Consider a request for 1 byte at alignment 0...)

Closes #11693
