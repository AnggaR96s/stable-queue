Subject: bonding: select current active slave when enslaving device for mode tlb and alb

From: Jiri Pirko <jpirko@redhat.com>

commit 5a29f7893fbe681f1334285be7e41e56f0de666c upstream.

I've hit an issue on my system when I've been using RealTek RTL8139D cards in
bonding interface in mode balancing-alb. When I enslave a card, the current
active slave (bond->curr_active_slave) is not set and the link is therefore
not functional.

----
# cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
Ethernet Channel Bonding Driver: v3.5.0 (November 4, 2008)

Bonding Mode: adaptive load balancing
Primary Slave: None
Currently Active Slave: None
MII Status: up
MII Polling Interval (ms): 100
Up Delay (ms): 0
Down Delay (ms): 0

Slave Interface: eth1
MII Status: up
Link Failure Count: 0
Permanent HW addr: 00:1f:1f:01:2f:22

The thing that gets it right is when I unplug the cable and then I put it back
into the NIC. Then the current active slave is set to eth1 and link is working
just fine. Here is dmesg log with bonding DEBUG messages turned on:

The current active slave is set by calling bond_select_active_slave() function
from bond_miimon_commit() function when the slave (eth1) link goes to state up.

I also tested this on other machine with Broadcom NetXtreme II BCM5708
1000Base-T NIC and there all works fine. The thing is that this adapter is down
and goes up after few seconds after it is enslaved.

This patch calls bond_select_active_slave() in bond_enslave() function for modes
alb and tlb and makes sure that the current active slave is set up properly even
when the slave state is already up. Tested on both systems, works fine.

Notice: The same problem can maybe also occrur in mode 8023AD but I'm unable to
test that.
