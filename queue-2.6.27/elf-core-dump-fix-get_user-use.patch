Subject: elf core dump: fix get_user use

From: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>

commit 92dc07b1f988e8c237a38e23be660b9b8533e6fd upstream.

The elf_core_dump() code does its work with set_fs(KERNEL_DS) in force,
so vma_dump_size() needs to switch back with set_fs(USER_DS) to safely
use get_user() for a normal user-space address.

Checking for VM_READ optimizes out the case where get_user() would fail
anyway.  The vm_file check here was already superfluous given the control
flow earlier in the function, so that is a cleanup/optimization unrelated
to other changes but an obvious and trivial one.
