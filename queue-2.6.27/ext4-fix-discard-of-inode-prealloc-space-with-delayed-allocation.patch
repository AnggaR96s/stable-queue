Subject: ext4: Fix discard of inode prealloc space with delayed allocation.

(cherry picked from commit d6014301b5599fba395c42a1e96a7fe86f7d0b2d)

With delayed allocation we should not/cannot discard inode prealloc
space during file close. We would still have dirty pages for which we
haven't allocated blocks yet. With this fix after each get_blocks
request we check whether we have zero reserved blocks and if yes and
we don't have any writers on the file we discard inode prealloc space.
