Subject: ipv4: additional update of dev_net(dev) to struct *net in ip_fragment.c, NULL ptr OOPS

From: David Ford <david@blue-labs.org>

commit bbf31bf18d34caa87dd01f08bf713635593697f2 upstream.

ipv4 ip_frag_reasm(), fully replace 'dev_net(dev)' with 'net', defined
previously patched into 2.6.29.

Between 2.6.28.10 and 2.6.29, net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c was patched,
changing from dev_net(dev) to container_of(...).  Unfortunately the goto
section (out_fail) on oversized packets inside ip_frag_reasm() didn't
get touched up as well.  Oversized IP packets cause a NULL pointer
dereference and immediate hang.

I discovered this running openvasd and my previous email on this is
titled:  NULL pointer dereference at 2.6.32-rc8:net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c:566
