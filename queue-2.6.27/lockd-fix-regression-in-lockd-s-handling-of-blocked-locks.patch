Subject: lockd: fix regression in lockd's handling of blocked locks

From: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@citi.umich.edu>

commit 9d9b87c1218be78ddecbc85ec3bb91c79c1d56ab upstream.

If a client requests a blocking lock, is denied, then requests it again,
then here in nlmsvc_lock() we will call vfs_lock_file() without FL_SLEEP
set, because we've already queued a block and don't need the locks code
to do it again.

But that means vfs_lock_file() will return -EAGAIN instead of
FILE_LOCK_DENIED.  So we still need to translate that -EAGAIN return
into a nlm_lck_blocked error in this case, and put ourselves back on
lockd's block list.

The bug was introduced by bde74e4bc64415b1 "locks: add special return
value for asynchronous locks".

Thanks to Frank van Maarseveen for the report; his original test
case was essentially

	for i in `seq 30`; do flock /nfsmount/foo sleep 10 & done
