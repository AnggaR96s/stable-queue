Subject: rt2x00: Disable powersaving for rt61pci and rt2800pci.

From: Gertjan van Wingerde <gwingerde@gmail.com>

commit 93b6bd26b74efe46b4579592560f9f1cb7b61994 upstream.

We've had many reports of rt61pci failures with powersaving enabled.
Therefore, as a stop-gap measure, disable powersaving of the rt61pci
until we have found a proper solution.
Also disable powersaving on rt2800pci as it most probably will show
the same problem.
