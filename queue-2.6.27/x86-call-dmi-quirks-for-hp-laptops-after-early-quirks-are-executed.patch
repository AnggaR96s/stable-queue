Subject: x86: call dmi-quirks for HP Laptops after early-quirks are executed
To: greg@kroah.com, chrisw@sous-sol.org
Cc: stable@kernel.org, Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Message-ID: <20081121114643.GD31951@alberich.amd.com>
Content-Disposition: inline

commit 35af28219e684a36cc8b1ff456c370ce22be157d upstream.

Impact: make warning message disappear - functionality unchanged

Problems with bogus IRQ0 override of those laptops should be fixed
with commits

x86: SB600: skip IRQ0 override if it is not routed to INT2 of IOAPIC
x86: SB450: skip IRQ0 override if it is not routed to INT2 of IOAPIC

that introduce early-quirks based on chipset configuration.

For further information, see
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11516

Instead of removing the related dmi-quirks completely we'd like to
keep them for (at least) one kernel version -- to double-check whether
the early-quirks really took effect. But the dmi-quirks need to be
called after early-quirks are executed. With this patch calling
sequence for dmi-quriks is changed as follows:

 acpi_boot_table_init()   (dmi-quirks)
 ...
 early_quirks()           (detect bogus IRQ0 override)
 ...
 acpi_boot_init()         (late dmi-quirks and setup IO APIC)

Note: Plan is to remove the "late dmi-quirks" with next kernel version.
