Making the freeing of q->queue dependent on q->pool being set looks
really weird (although it is correct at the moment. But this seems
to be fixable in a much simpler way.

With the benefit that only the error case is slowed down. In both
cases we have a problem if q->queue contains an error value but it's
not -ENOMEM. Apparently this can't happen today, but it doesn't feel
right to assume this will always be true. Maybe it's the right time
to fix this as well.
