Subject: fs: make sure data stored into inode is properly seen before unlocking new inode

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

commit 580be0837a7a59b207c3d5c661d044d8dd0a6a30 upstream.

In theory it could happen that on one CPU we initialize a new inode but
clearing of I_NEW | I_LOCK gets reordered before some of the
initialization.  Thus on another CPU we return not fully uptodate inode
from iget_locked().

This seems to fix a corruption issue on ext3 mounted over NFS.
