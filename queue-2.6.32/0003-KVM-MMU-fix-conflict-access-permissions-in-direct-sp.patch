From: Xiao Guangrong <xiaoguangrong@cn.fujitsu.com>

commit 5fd5387c89ec99ff6cb82d2477ffeb7211b781c2 upstream.

In no-direct mapping, we mark sp is 'direct' when we mapping the
guest's larger page, but its access is encoded form upper page-struct
entire not include the last mapping, it will cause access conflict.

For example, have this mapping:
        [W]
      / PDE1 -> |---|
  P[W]          |   | LPA
      \ PDE2 -> |---|
        [R]

P have two children, PDE1 and PDE2, both PDE1 and PDE2 mapping the
same lage page(LPA). The P's access is WR, PDE1's access is WR,
PDE2's access is RO(just consider read-write permissions here)

When guest access PDE1, we will create a direct sp for LPA, the sp's
access is from P, is W, then we will mark the ptes is W in this sp.

Then, guest access PDE2, we will find LPA's shadow page, is the same as
PDE's, and mark the ptes is RO.

So, if guest access PDE1, the incorrect #PF is occured.

Fixed by encode the last mapping access into direct shadow page
