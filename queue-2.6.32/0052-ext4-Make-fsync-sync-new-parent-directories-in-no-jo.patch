Subject: ext4: Make fsync sync new parent directories in no-journal mode

commit 14ece1028b3ed53ffec1b1213ffc6acaf79ad77c upstream (as of v2.6.34-git13)

Add a new ext4 state to tell us when a file has been newly created; use
that state in ext4_sync_file in no-journal mode to tell us when we need
to sync the parent directory as well as the inode and data itself.  This
fixes a problem in which a panic or power failure may lose the entire
file even when using fsync, since the parent directory entry is lost.
