commit 8f9e0ee38f75d4740daa9e42c8af628d33d19a02 upstream.

Commit 4044ba58dd15cb01797c4fd034f39ef4a75f7cc3 supposedly fixed a
problem where if a raid1 with just one good device gets a read-error
during recovery, the recovery would abort and immediately restart in
an infinite loop.

However it depended on raid1_remove_disk removing the spare device
from the array.  But that does not happen in this case.  So add a test
so that in the 'recovery_disabled' case, the device will be removed.

This suitable for any kernel since 2.6.29 which is when
recovery_disabled was introduced.
