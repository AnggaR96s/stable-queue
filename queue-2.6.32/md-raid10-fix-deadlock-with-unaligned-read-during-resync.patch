Subject: md/raid10: fix deadlock with unaligned read during resync

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit 51e9ac77035a3dfcb6fc0a88a0d80b6f99b5edb1 upstream.

If the 'bio_split' path in raid10-read is used while
resync/recovery is happening it is possible to deadlock.
Fix this be elevating ->nr_waiting for the duration of both
parts of the split request.

This fixes a bug that has been present since 2.6.22
but has only started manifesting recently for unknown reasons.
It is suitable for and -stable since then.
