Subject: mm: make stack guard page logic use vm_prev pointer

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

commit 0e8e50e20c837eeec8323bba7dcd25fe5479194c upstream.

Like the mlock() change previously, this makes the stack guard check
code use vma->vm_prev to see what the mapping below the current stack
is, rather than have to look it up with find_vma().

Also, accept an abutting stack segment, since that happens naturally if
you split the stack with mlock or mprotect.
