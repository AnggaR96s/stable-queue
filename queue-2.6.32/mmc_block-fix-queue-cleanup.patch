Subject: mmc_block: fix queue cleanup

From: Adrian Hunter <adrian.hunter@nokia.com>

commit 5fa83ce284a4b7cd9dcfadd01500b0ed4ab9b740 upstream.

The main bug was that 'blk_cleanup_queue()' was called while the block
device could still be in use, for example, because the card was removed
while files were still open.

In addition, to be sure that 'mmc_request()' will get called for all new
requests (so it can error them out), the queue is emptied during cleanup.
This is done after the worker thread is stopped to avoid racing with it.

Finally, it is not a device error for this to be happening, so quiet the
(sometimes very many) error messages.
