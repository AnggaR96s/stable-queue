Subject: rcu: Fix synchronization for rcu_process_gp_end() uses of ->completed counter

From: Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit d09b62dfa336447c52a5ec9bb88adbc479b0f3b8 upstream.

Impose a clear locking design on the rcu_process_gp_end()
function's use of the ->completed counter.  This is done by
creating a ->completed field in the rcu_node structure, which
can safely be accessed under the protection of that structure's
lock.  Performance and scalability are maintained by using a
form of double-checked locking, so that rcu_process_gp_end()
only acquires the leaf rcu_node structure's ->lock if a grace
period has recently ended.

This fix reduces rcutorture failure rate by at least two orders
of magnitude under heavy stress with force_quiescent_state()
being invoked artificially often.  Without this fix,
unsynchronized access to the ->completed field can cause
rcu_process_gp_end() to advance callbacks whose grace period has
not yet expired.  (Bad idea!)
