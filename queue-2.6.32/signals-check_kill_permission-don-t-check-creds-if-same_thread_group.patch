Subject: signals: check_kill_permission(): don't check creds if same_thread_group()

From: Oleg Nesterov <oleg@redhat.com>

commit 065add3941bdca54fe04ed3471a96bce9af88793 upstream.

Andrew Tridgell reports that aio_read(SIGEV_SIGNAL) can fail if the
notification from the helper thread races with setresuid(), see
http://samba.org/~tridge/junkcode/aio_uid.c

This happens because check_kill_permission() doesn't permit sending a
signal to the task with the different cred->xids.  But there is not any
security reason to check ->cred's when the task sends a signal (private or
group-wide) to its sub-thread.  Whatever we do, any thread can bypass all
security checks and send SIGKILL to all threads, or it can block a signal
SIG and do kill(gettid(), SIG) to deliver this signal to another
sub-thread.  Not to mention that CLONE_THREAD implies CLONE_VM.

Change check_kill_permission() to avoid the credentials check when the
sender and the target are from the same thread group.

Also, move "cred = current_cred()" down to avoid calling get_current()
twice.

Note: David Howells pointed out we could relax this even more, the
CLONE_SIGHAND (without CLONE_THREAD) case probably does not need
these checks too.

Roland said:
: The glibc (libpthread) that does set*id across threads has
: been in use for a while (2.3.4?), probably in distro's using kernels as old
: or older than any active -stable streams.  In the race in question, this
: kernel bug is breaking valid POSIX application expectations.
