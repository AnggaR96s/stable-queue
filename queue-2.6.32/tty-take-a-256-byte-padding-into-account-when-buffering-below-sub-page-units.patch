Subject: tty: Take a 256 byte padding into account when buffering below sub-page units

From: Mel Gorman <mel@csn.ul.ie>

commit 352fa6ad16b89f8ffd1a93b4419b1a8f2259feab upstream.

The TTY layer takes some care to ensure that only sub-page allocations
are made with interrupts disabled. It does this by setting a goal of
"TTY_BUFFER_PAGE" to allocate. Unfortunately, while TTY_BUFFER_PAGE takes the
size of tty_buffer into account, it fails to account that tty_buffer_find()
rounds the buffer size out to the next 256 byte boundary before adding on
the size of the tty_buffer.

This patch adjusts the TTY_BUFFER_PAGE calculation to take into account the
size of the tty_buffer and the padding. Once applied, tty_buffer_alloc()
should not require high-order allocations.
