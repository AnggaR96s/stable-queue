Subject: x86: hpet: Make WARN_ON understandable

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit 18ed61da985c57eea3fe8038b13fa2837c9b3c3f upstream.

Andrew complained rightly that the WARN_ON in hpet_next_event() is
confusing and the code comment not really helpful.

Change it to WARN_ONCE and print the reason in clear text. Change the
comment to explain what kind of hardware wreckage we deal with.
