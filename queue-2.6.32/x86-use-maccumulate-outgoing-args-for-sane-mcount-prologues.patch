Subject: x86: Use -maccumulate-outgoing-args for sane mcount prologues

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit b8b7d791a8ff01d2380089279a69afa99115fb23 upstream.

commit 746357d (x86: Prevent GCC 4.4.x (pentium-mmx et al) function
prologue wreckage) uses -mtune=generic to work around the function
prologue problem with mcount on -march=pentium-mmx and others.

Jakub pointed out that we can use -maccumulate-outgoing-args instead
which is selected by -mtune=generic and prevents the problem without
losing the -march specific optimizations.
