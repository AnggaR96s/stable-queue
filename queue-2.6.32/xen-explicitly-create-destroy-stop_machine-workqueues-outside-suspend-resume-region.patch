Subject: xen: explicitly create/destroy stop_machine workqueues outside suspend/resume region.

From: Ian Campbell <ian.campbell@citrix.com>

commit b4606f2165153833247823e8c04c5e88cb3d298b upstream.

I have observed cases where the implicit stop_machine_destroy() done by
stop_machine() hangs while destroying the workqueues, specifically in
kthread_stop(). This seems to be because timer ticks are not restarted
until after stop_machine() returns.

Fortunately stop_machine provides a facility to pre-create/post-destroy
the workqueues so use this to ensure that workqueues are only destroyed
after everything is really up and running again.

I only actually observed this failure with 2.6.30. It seems that newer
kernels are somehow more robust against doing kthread_stop() without timer
interrupts (I tried some backports of some likely looking candidates but
did not track down the commit which added this robustness). However this
change seems like a reasonable belt&braces thing to do.
