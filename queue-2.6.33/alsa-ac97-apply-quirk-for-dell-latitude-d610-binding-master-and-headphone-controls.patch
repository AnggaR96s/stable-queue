Subject: ALSA: ac97: Apply quirk for Dell Latitude D610 binding Master and Headphone controls

From: Daniel T Chen <crimsun@ubuntu.com>

commit 0613a59456980161d0cd468bae6c63d772743102 upstream.

BugLink: https://launchpad.net/bugs/669279

The original reporter states: "The Master mixer does not change the
volume from the headphone output (which is affected by the headphone
mixer). Instead it only seems to control the on-board speaker volume.
This confuses PulseAudio greatly as the Master channel is merged into
the volume mix."

Fix this symptom by applying the hp_only quirk for the reporter's SSID.
The fix is applicable to all stable kernels.
