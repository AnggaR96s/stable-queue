Subject: oom: fix the unsafe usage of badness() in proc_oom_score()

From: Oleg Nesterov <oleg@redhat.com>

commit b95c35e76b29ba812e5dabdd91592e25ec640e93 upstream.

proc_oom_score(task) has a reference to task_struct, but that is all.
If this task was already released before we take tasklist_lock

	- we can't use task->group_leader, it points to nowhere

	- it is not safe to call badness() even if this task is
	  ->group_leader, has_intersects_mems_allowed() assumes
	  it is safe to iterate over ->thread_group list.

	- even worse, badness() can hit ->signal == NULL

Add the pid_alive() check to ensure __unhash_process() was not called.

Also, use "task" instead of task->group_leader. badness() should return
the same result for any sub-thread. Currently this is not true, but
this should be changed anyway.
