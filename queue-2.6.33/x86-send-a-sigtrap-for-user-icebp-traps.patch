Subject: x86: Send a SIGTRAP for user icebp traps

From: Frederic Weisbecker <fweisbec@gmail.com>

commit a1e80fafc9f0742a1776a0490258cb64912411b0 upstream.

Before we had a generic breakpoint layer, x86 used to send a
sigtrap for any debug event that happened in userspace,
except if it was caused by lazy dr7 switches.

Currently we only send such signal for single step or breakpoint
events.

However, there are three other kind of debug exceptions:

- debug register access detected: trigger an exception if the
  next instruction touches the debug registers. We don't use
  it.
- task switch, but we don't use tss.
- icebp/int01 trap. This instruction (0xf1) is undocumented and
  generates an int 1 exception. Unlike single step through TF
  flag, it doesn't set the single step origin of the exception
  in dr6.

icebp then used to be reported in userspace using trap signals
but this have been incidentally broken with the new breakpoint
code. Reenable this. Since this is the only debug event that
doesn't set anything in dr6, this is all we have to check.

This fixes a regression in Wine where World Of Warcraft got broken
as it uses this for software protection checks purposes. And
probably other apps do.
