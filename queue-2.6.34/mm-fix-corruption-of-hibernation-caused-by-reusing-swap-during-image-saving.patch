Subject: mm: fix corruption of hibernation caused by reusing swap during image saving

From: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>

commit 966cca029f739716fbcc8068b8c6dfe381f86fc3 upstream.

Since 2.6.31, swap_map[]'s refcounting was changed to show that a used
swap entry is just for swap-cache, can be reused.  Then, while scanning
free entry in swap_map[], a swap entry may be able to be reclaimed and
reused.  It was caused by commit c9e444103b5e7a5 ("mm: reuse unused swap
entry if necessary").

But this caused deta corruption at resume. The scenario is

- Assume a clean-swap cache, but mapped.

- at hibernation_snapshot[], clean-swap-cache is saved as
  clean-swap-cache and swap_map[] is marked as SWAP_HAS_CACHE.

- then, save_image() is called.  And reuse SWAP_HAS_CACHE entry to save
  image, and break the contents.

After resume:

- the memory reclaim runs and finds clean-not-referenced-swap-cache and
  discards it because it's marked as clean.  But here, the contents on
  disk and swap-cache is inconsistent.

Hance memory is corrupted.

This patch avoids the bug by not reclaiming swap-entry during hibernation.
This is a quick fix for backporting.
