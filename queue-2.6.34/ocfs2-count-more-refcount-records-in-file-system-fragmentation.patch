Subject: ocfs2: Count more refcount records in file system fragmentation.

From: Tao Ma <tao.ma@oracle.com>

commit 8a2e70c40ff58f82dde67770e6623ca45f0cb0c8 upstream.

The refcount record calculation in ocfs2_calc_refcount_meta_credits
is too optimistic that we can always allocate contiguous clusters
and handle an already existed refcount rec as a whole. Actually
because of file system fragmentation, we may have the chance to split
a refcount record into 3 parts during the transaction. So consider
the worst case in record calculation.
