Subject: USB: xhci: Remove buggy assignment in next_trb()

From: John Youn <John.Youn@synopsys.com>

commit a1669b2c64a9c8b031e0ac5cbf2692337a577f7c upstream.

The code to increment the TRB pointer has a slight ambiguity that could
lead to a bug on different compilers.  The ANSI C specification does not
specify the precedence of the assignment operator over the postfix
operator.  gcc 4.4 produced the correct code (increment the pointer and
assign the value), but a MIPS compiler that one of John's clients used
assigned the old (unincremented) value.

Remove the unnecessary assignment to make all compilers produce the
correct assembly.
