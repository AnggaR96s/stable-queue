Subject: md: Fix removal of extra drives when converting RAID6 to RAID5

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit bf2cb0dab8c97f00a71875d9b13dbac17a2f47ca upstream.

When a RAID6 is converted to a RAID5, the extra drive should
be discarded.  However it isn't due to a typo in a comparison.

This bug was introduced in commit e93f68a1fc6 in 2.6.35-rc4
and is suitable for any -stable since than.

As the extra drive is not removed, the 'degraded' counter is wrong and
so the RAID5 will not respond correctly to a subsequent failure.
