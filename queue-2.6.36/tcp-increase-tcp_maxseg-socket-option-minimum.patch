Subject: tcp: Increase TCP_MAXSEG socket option minimum.


From: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

[ Upstream commit 7a1abd08d52fdeddb3e9a5a33f2f15cc6a5674d2 ]

As noted by Steve Chen, since commit
f5fff5dc8a7a3f395b0525c02ba92c95d42b7390 ("tcp: advertise MSS
requested by user") we can end up with a situation where
tcp_select_initial_window() does a divide by a zero (or
even negative) mss value.

The problem is that sometimes we effectively subtract
TCPOLEN_TSTAMP_ALIGNED and/or TCPOLEN_MD5SIG_ALIGNED from the mss.

Fix this by increasing the minimum from 8 to 64.
