Subject: block: use the passed in @bdev when claiming if partno is
 zero

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit d4c208b86b8be4254eba0e74071496e599f94639 upstream.

6b4517a791 (block: implement bd_claiming and claiming block)
introduced claiming block to support O_EXCL blkdev opens properly.

bd_start_claiming() looks up the part 0 bdev and starts claiming
block.  The function assumed that there is only one part 0 bdev and
always used bdget_disk(disk, 0) to look it up; unfortunately, this
isn't true for some drivers (floppy) which use multiple block devices
to denote different operating parameters for the same physical device.
There can be multiple part 0 bdev's for the same device number.

This incorrect assumption caused the wrong bdev to be used during
claiming leading to unbalanced bd_holders as reported in the following
bug.

  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28522

This patch updates bd_start_claiming() such that it uses the bdev
specified as argument if its partno is zero.

Note that this means that different bdev's can be used for the same
device and O_EXCL check can be effectively bypassed.  It has always
been broken that way and floppy is fortunately on its way out.  Leave
that breakage alone.
