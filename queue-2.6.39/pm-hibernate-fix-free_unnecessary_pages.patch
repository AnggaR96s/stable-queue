Subject: PM / Hibernate: Fix free_unnecessary_pages()

From: "Rafael J. Wysocki" <rjw@sisk.pl>

commit 4d4cf23cdde2f8f9324f5684a7f349e182039529 upstream.

There is a bug in free_unnecessary_pages() that causes it to
attempt to free too many pages in some cases, which triggers the
BUG_ON() in memory_bm_clear_bit() for copy_bm.  Namely, if
count_data_pages() is initially greater than alloc_normal, we get
to_free_normal equal to 0 and "save" greater from 0.  In that case,
if the sum of "save" and count_highmem_pages() is greater than
alloc_highmem, we subtract a positive number from to_free_normal.
Hence, since to_free_normal was 0 before the subtraction and is
an unsigned int, the result is converted to a huge positive number
that is used as the number of pages to free.

Fix this bug by checking if to_free_normal is actually greater
than or equal to the number we're going to subtract from it.
