Subject: ARM: fix bad applied patch for arch/arm/Kconfig of stable 3.0.y tree.
To: greg@kroah.com

From: Tetsuyuki Kobayashi <koba@kmckk.co.jp>

No upstream commit as this is a merge error in the 3.0 tree.

ARM_ERRATA_764369 and PL310_ERRATA_769419 do not appear in config menu in
stable 3.0.y tree.
This is because backported patch for arm/arm/Kconfig applied wrong place.
This patch solves it.
