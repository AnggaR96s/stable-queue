Subject: cbq: incorrect processing of high limits


From: Vasily Averin <vvs@parallels.com>

[ Upstream commit f0f6ee1f70c4eaab9d52cf7d255df4bd89f8d1c2 ]

currently cbq works incorrectly for limits > 10% real link bandwidth,
and practically does not work for limits > 50% real link bandwidth.
Below are results of experiments taken on 1 Gbit link

 In shaper | Actual Result
-----------+---------------
  100M     | 108 Mbps
  200M     | 244 Mbps
  300M     | 412 Mbps
  500M     | 893 Mbps

This happen because of q->now changes incorrectly in cbq_dequeue():
when it is called before real end of packet transmitting,
L2T is greater than real time delay, q_now gets an extra boost
but never compensate it.

To fix this problem we prevent change of q->now until its synchronization
with real time.
