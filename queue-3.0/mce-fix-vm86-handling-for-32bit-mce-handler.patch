Subject: MCE: Fix vm86 handling for 32bit mce handler

From: Andi Kleen <andi@firstfloor.org>

commit a129a7c84582629741e5fa6f40026efcd7a65bd4 upstream.

When running on 32bit the mce handler could misinterpret
vm86 mode as ring 0. This can affect whether it does recovery
or not; it was possible to panic when recovery was actually
possible.

Fix this by always forcing vm86 to look like ring 3.

[ Backport to 3.0 notes:
Things changed there slightly:
   - move mce_get_rip() up. It fills up m->cs and m->ip values which
     are evaluated in mce_severity(). Therefore move it up right before
     the mce_severity call. This seem to be another bug in 3.0?
   - Place the backport (fix m->cs in V86 case) to where m->cs gets
     filled which is mce_get_rip() in 3.0
