Subject: mm: memory hotplug: Check if pages are correctly reserved on a per-section basis

From: Mel Gorman <mgorman@suse.de>

commit 2bbcb8788311a40714b585fc11b51da6ffa2ab92 upstream.

Stable note: Fixes https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=721039 .
        Without the patch, memory hot-add can fail for kernel configurations
        that do not set CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP.

(Resending as I am not seeing it in -next so maybe it got lost)

mm: memory hotplug: Check if pages are correctly reserved on a per-section basis

It is expected that memory being brought online is PageReserved
similar to what happens when the page allocator is being brought up.
Memory is onlined in "memory blocks" which consist of one or more
sections. Unfortunately, the code that verifies PageReserved is
currently assuming that the memmap backing all these pages is virtually
contiguous which is only the case when CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP is set.
As a result, memory hot-add is failing on those configurations with
the message;

kernel: section number XXX page number 256 not reserved, was it already online?

This patch updates the PageReserved check to lookup struct page once
per section to guarantee the correct struct page is being checked.
