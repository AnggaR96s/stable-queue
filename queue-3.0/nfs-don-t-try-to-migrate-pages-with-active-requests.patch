Subject: nfs: don't try to migrate pages with active requests

From: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com>

commit 2da956523526e440ef4f4dd174e26f5ac06fe011 upstream.

nfs_find_and_lock_request will take a reference to the nfs_page and
will then put it if the req is already locked. It's possible though
that the reference will be the last one. That put then can kick off
a whole series of reference puts:

nfs_page
   nfs_open_context
      dentry
          inode

If the inode ends up being deleted, then the VFS will call
truncate_inode_pages. That function will try to take the page lock, but
it was already locked when migrate_page was called. The code
deadlocks.

Fix this by simply refusing the migration request if PagePrivate is
already set, indicating that the page is already associated with an
active read or write request.

We've had a customer test a backported version of this patch and
the preliminary results seem good.
