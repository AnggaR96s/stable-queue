Subject: powerpc: pSeries_lpar_hpte_remove fails from Adjunct partition being performed before the ANDCOND test

From: Michael Wolf <mjw@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit 9fb2640159f9d4f5a2a9d60e490482d4cbecafdb upstream.

Some versions of pHyp will perform the adjunct partition test before the
ANDCOND test.  The result of this is that H_RESOURCE can be returned and
cause the BUG_ON condition to occur. The HPTE is not removed.  So add a
check for H_RESOURCE, it is ok if this HPTE is not removed as
pSeries_lpar_hpte_remove is looking for an HPTE to remove and not a
specific HPTE to remove.  So it is ok to just move on to the next slot
and try again.
