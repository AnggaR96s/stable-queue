Subject: tcm_loop: Add explict read buffer memset for SCF_SCSI_CONTROL_SG_IO_CDB

From: Nicholas Bellinger <nab@linux-iscsi.org>

commit 8cd79f24350826b81e16990d9e12bc878e67d385 upstream.

This patch addresses an issue with buggy userspace code sending I/O
via scsi-generic that does not explictly clear their associated read
buffers.  It adds an explict memset of the first SGL entry within
tcm_loop_new_cmd_map() for SCF_SCSI_CONTROL_SG_IO_CDB payloads that
are currently guaranteed to be a single SGL by target-core code.

This issue is a side effect of the v3.1-rc1 merge to remove the
extra memcpy between certain control CDB types using a contigious
+ cleared buffer in target-core, and performing a memcpy into the
SGL list within tcm_loop.

It was originally mainfesting itself by udev + scsi_id + scsi-generic
not properly setting up the expected /dev/disk/by-id/ symlinks because
the INQUIRY payload was containing extra bogus data preventing the
proper NAA IEEE WWN from being parsed by userspace.
