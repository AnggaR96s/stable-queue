Subject: vmscan: abort reclaim/compaction if compaction can proceed

From: Mel Gorman <mgorman@suse.de>

commit e0c23279c9f800c403f37511484d9014ac83adec upstream.

Stable note: Not tracked on Bugzilla. THP and compaction was found to
	aggressively reclaim pages and stall systems under different
	situations that was addressed piecemeal over time.

If compaction can proceed, shrink_zones() stops doing any work but its
callers still call shrink_slab() which raises the priority and potentially
sleeps.  This is unnecessary and wasteful so this patch aborts direct
reclaim/compaction entirely if compaction can proceed.
