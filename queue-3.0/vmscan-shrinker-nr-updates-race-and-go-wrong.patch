Subject: vmscan: shrinker->nr updates race and go wrong

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

commit acf92b485cccf028177f46918e045c0c4e80ee10 upstream.

Stable note: Not tracked in Bugzilla. This patch reduces excessive
	reclaim of slab objects reducing the amount of information
	that has to be brought back in from disk.

shrink_slab() allows shrinkers to be called in parallel so the
struct shrinker can be updated concurrently. It does not provide any
exclusio for such updates, so we can get the shrinker->nr value
increasing or decreasing incorrectly.

As a result, when a shrinker repeatedly returns a value of -1 (e.g.
a VFS shrinker called w/ GFP_NOFS), the shrinker->nr goes haywire,
sometimes updating with the scan count that wasn't used, sometimes
losing it altogether. Worse is when a shrinker does work and that
update is lost due to racy updates, which means the shrinker will do
the work again!

Fix this by making the total_scan calculations independent of
shrinker->nr, and making the shrinker->nr updates atomic w.r.t. to
other updates via cmpxchg loops.
