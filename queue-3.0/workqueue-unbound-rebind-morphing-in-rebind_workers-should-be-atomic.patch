Subject: workqueue: UNBOUND -> REBIND morphing in rebind_workers() should be atomic

From: Lai Jiangshan <laijs@cn.fujitsu.com>

commit 96e65306b81351b656835c15931d1d237b252f27 upstream.

The compiler may compile the following code into TWO write/modify
instructions.

	worker->flags &= ~WORKER_UNBOUND;
	worker->flags |= WORKER_REBIND;

so the other CPU may temporarily see worker->flags which doesn't have
either WORKER_UNBOUND or WORKER_REBIND set and perform local wakeup
prematurely.

Fix it by using single explicit assignment via ACCESS_ONCE().

Because idle workers have another WORKER_NOT_RUNNING flag, this bug
doesn't exist for them; however, update it to use the same pattern for
consistency.

tj: Applied the change to idle workers too and updated comments and
    patch description a bit.
