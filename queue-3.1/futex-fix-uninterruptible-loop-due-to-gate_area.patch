Subject: futex: Fix uninterruptible loop due to gate_area

From: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>

commit e6780f7243eddb133cc20ec37fa69317c218b709 upstream.

It was found (by Sasha) that if you use a futex located in the gate
area we get stuck in an uninterruptible infinite loop, much like the
ZERO_PAGE issue.

While looking at this problem, PeterZ realized you'll get into similar
trouble when hitting any install_special_pages() mapping.  And are there
still drivers setting up their own special mmaps without page->mapping,
and without special VM or pte flags to make get_user_pages fail?

In most cases, if page->mapping is NULL, we do not need to retry at all:
Linus points out that even /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches poses no problem,
because it ends up using remove_mapping(), which takes care not to
interfere when the page reference count is raised.

But there is still one case which does need a retry: if memory pressure
called shmem_writepage in between get_user_pages_fast dropping page
table lock and our acquiring page lock, then the page gets switched from
filecache to swapcache (and ->mapping set to NULL) whatever the refcount.
Fault it back in to get the page->mapping needed for key->shared.inode.
