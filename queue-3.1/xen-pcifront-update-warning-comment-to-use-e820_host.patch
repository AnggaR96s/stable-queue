Subject: xen-pcifront: Update warning comment to use 'e820_host'
 option.

From: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>

commit 917e3e65c35459d52f0d0b890aa5df0cad07a051 upstream.

With Xen changeset 23428 "libxl: Add 'e820_host' option to config file"
the E820 as seen from the host can now be passed into the guest.
This means that a PV guest can now:
 - Use the correct PCI I/O gap. Before these patches, Linux guest would
   boot up and would tell:
   [    0.000000] Allocating PCI resources starting at 40000000 (gap: 40000000:c0000000)
   while in actuality the PCI I/O gap should have been:
   [    0.000000] Allocating PCI resources starting at b0000000 (gap: b0000000:4c000000)

 - The PV domain with PCI devices was limited to 3GB. It now can be booted
   with 4GB, 8GB, or whatever number you want. The PCI devices will now _not_ conflict
   with System RAM. Meaning the drivers can load.
