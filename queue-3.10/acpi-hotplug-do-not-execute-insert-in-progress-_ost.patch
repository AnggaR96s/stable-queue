Subject: ACPI / hotplug: Do not execute "insert in progress" _OST

From: "Rafael J. Wysocki" <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

commit 176a88d79d6b5aebabaff16734e8b3107efcaaad upstream.

According to the ACPI spec (5.0, Section 6.3.5), the "Device
insertion in progress (pending)" (0x80) _OST status code is
reserved for the "Insertion Processing" (0x200) source event
which is "a result of an OSPM action".  Specifically, it is not
a notification, so that status code should not be used during
notification processing, which unfortunately is done by
acpi_scan_bus_device_check().

For this reason, drop the ACPI_OST_SC_INSERT_IN_PROGRESS _OST
status evaluation from there (it was a mistake to put it in there
in the first place).
