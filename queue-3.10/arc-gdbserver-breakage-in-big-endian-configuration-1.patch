Subject: ARC: gdbserver breakage in Big-Endian configuration #1

[Based on mainline commit 502a0c775c7f0a: "ARC: pt_regs update #5"]

gdbserver needs @stop_pc, served by ptrace, but fetched from pt_regs
differently, based on in_brkpt_traps(), which in turn relies on
additional machine state in pt_regs->event bitfield.

        unsigned long orig_r8:16, event:16;

For big endian config, this macro was returning false, despite being in
breakpoint Trap exception, causing wrong @stop_pc to be returned to gdb.

Issue #1: In BE, @event above is at offset 2 in word, while a STW insn
          at offset 0 was used to update it. Resort to using ST insn
	  which updates the half-word at right location.

Issue #2: The union involving bitfields causes all the members to be
	  laid out at offset 0. So with fix #1 above, ASM was now
	  updating at offset 2, "C" code was still referencing at
	  offset 0. Fixed by wrapping bitfield in a struct.
