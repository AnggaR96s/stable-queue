Subject: ARM: 7767/1: let the ASID allocator handle suspended animation

From: Marc Zyngier <Marc.Zyngier@arm.com>

commit ae120d9edfe96628f03d87634acda0bfa7110632 upstream.

When a CPU is running a process, the ASID for that process is
held in a per-CPU variable (the "active ASIDs" array). When
the ASID allocator handles a rollover, it copies the active
ASIDs into a "reserved ASIDs" array to ensure that a process
currently running on another CPU will continue to run unaffected.
The active array is zero-ed to indicate that a rollover occurred.

Because of this mechanism, a reserved ASID is only remembered for
a single rollover. A subsequent rollover will completely refill
the reserved ASIDs array.

In a severely oversubscribed environment where a CPU can be
prevented from running for extended periods of time (think virtual
machines), the above has a horrible side effect:

[P{a} denotes process P running with ASID a]

	CPU-0		CPU-1

	A{x}				[active = <x 0>]

	[suspended]	runs B{y}	[active = <x y>]

					[rollover:
					 active = <0 0>
					 reserved = <x y>]

			runs B{y}	[active = <0 y>
					 reserved = <x y>]

					[rollover:
					 active = <0 0>
					 reserved = <0 y>]

			runs C{x}	[active = <0 x>]

	[resumes]

	runs A{x}

At that stage, both A and C have the same ASID, with deadly
consequences.

The fix is to preserve reserved ASIDs across rollovers if
the CPU doesn't have an active ASID when the rollover occurs.
