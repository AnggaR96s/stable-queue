Subject: drm/i915: Fix incoherence with fence updates on Sandybridge+

From: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>

commit d18b9619034230b6f945e215276425636ca401fe upstream.

This hopefully fixes the root cause behind the workaround added in

    drm/i915: Workaround incoherence between fences and LLC across multiple CPUs

Thanks to further investigation by Jon Bloomfield, he realised that
the 64-bit register might be broken up by the hardware into two 32-bit
writes (a problem we have encountered elsewhere). This non-atomicity
would then cause an issue where a second thread would see an
intermediate register state (new high dword, old low dword), and this
register would randomly be used in preference to its own thread register.
This would cause the second thread to read from and write into a fairly
random tiled location.  Breaking the operation into 3 explicit 32-bit
updates (first disable the fence, poke the upper bits, then poke the lower
bits and enable) ensures that, given proper serialisation between the
32-bit register write and the memory transfer, that the fence value is
always consistent.

Armed with this knowledge, we can explain how the previous workaround
work. The key to the corruption is that a second thread sees an
erroneous fence register that conflicts and overrides its own. By
serialising the fence update across all CPUs, we have a small window
where no GTT access is occurring and so hide the potential corruption.
This also leads to the conclusion that the earlier workaround was
incomplete.

v2: Be overly paranoid about the order in which fence updates become
visible to the GPU to make really sure that we turn the fence off before
doing the update, and then only switch the fence on afterwards.
