Subject: md/raid10: remove use-after-free bug.

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit 0eb25bb027a100f5a9df8991f2f628e7d851bc1e upstream.

We always need to be careful when calling generic_make_request, as it
can start a chain of events which might free something that we are
using.

Here is one place I wasn't careful enough.  If the wbio2 is not in
use, then it might get freed at the first generic_make_request call.
So perform all necessary tests first.

This bug was introduced in 3.3-rc3 (24afd80d99) and can cause an
oops, so fix is suitable for any -stable since then.
