Subject: powerpc: ppc64 address space capped at 32TB, mmap randomisation disabled

From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>

commit 5a049f14902982c26538250bdc8d54156d357252 upstream.

Commit fba2369e6ceb (mm: use vm_unmapped_area() on powerpc architecture)
has a bug in slice_scan_available() where we compare an unsigned long
(high_slices) against a shifted int. As a result, comparisons against
the top 32 bits of high_slices (representing the top 32TB) always
returns 0 and the top of our mmap region is clamped at 32TB

This also breaks mmap randomisation since the randomised address is
always up near the top of the address space and it gets clamped down
to 32TB.
