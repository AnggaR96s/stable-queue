Subject: powerpc/tm: Fix return of active 64bit signals

From: Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>

commit 87b4e5393af77f5cba124638f19f6c426e210aec upstream.

Currently we only restore signals which are transactionally suspended but it's
possible that the transaction can be restored even when it's active.  Most
likely this will result in a transactional rollback by the hardware as the
transaction will have been doomed by an earlier treclaim.

The current code is a legacy of earlier kernel implementations which did
software rollback of active transactions in the kernel.  That code has now gone
but we didn't correctly fix up this part of the signals code which still makes
assumptions based on having software rollback.

This changes the signal return code to always restore both contexts on 64 bit
signal return.  It also ensures that the MSR TM bits are properly restored from
the signal context which they are not currently.
