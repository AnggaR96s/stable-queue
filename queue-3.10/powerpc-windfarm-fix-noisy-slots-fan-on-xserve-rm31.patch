Subject: powerpc/windfarm: Fix noisy slots-fan on Xserve (rm31)

From: Aaro Koskinen <aaro.koskinen@iki.fi>

commit fe956a1d4081ce1a959f87df397a15e252201f10 upstream.

slots-fan on G5 Xserve is always running at full speed with windfarm_rm31
driver, resulting in a very high acoustic noise level. It seems the fan
parameters are incorrect, and have been copied from the Drive Bay fan
(RPM, not present on rm31) of the legacy therm_pm72 driver. This patch
changes the parameters to match the Slots fan (PWM) of therm_pm72. With
the patch, slots-fan speed drops from 99% to 19% during normal use,
and slots-temp settle to ~42'C.
