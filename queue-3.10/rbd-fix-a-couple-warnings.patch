Subject: rbd: fix a couple warnings

From: Sage Weil <sage@inktank.com>

commit e976cad0f0dbe5440a4ca38e29e1f932d9319125 upstream.

gcc isn't quite smart enough and generates these warnings:

drivers/block/rbd.c: In function 'rbd_img_request_fill':
drivers/block/rbd.c:1266:22: warning: 'bio_list' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
drivers/block/rbd.c:2186:14: note: 'bio_list' was declared here
drivers/block/rbd.c:2247:10: warning: 'pages' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

even though they are initialized for their respective code paths.
