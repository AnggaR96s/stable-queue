Subject: Revert "ima: policy for RAMFS"

From: Mimi Zohar <zohar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit 08de59eb144d7c41351a467442f898d720f0f15f upstream.

This reverts commit 4c2c392763a682354fac65b6a569adec4e4b5387.

Everything in the initramfs should be measured and appraised,
but until the initramfs has extended attribute support, at
least measured.
