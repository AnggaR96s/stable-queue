Subject: xen/p2m: check MFN is in range before using the m2p table

From: David Vrabel <david.vrabel@citrix.com>

commit 0160676bba69523e8b0ac83f306cce7d342ed7c8 upstream.

On hosts with more than 168 GB of memory, a 32-bit guest may attempt
to grant map an MFN that is error cannot lookup in its mapping of the
m2p table.  There is an m2p lookup as part of m2p_add_override() and
m2p_remove_override().  The lookup falls off the end of the mapped
portion of the m2p and (because the mapping is at the highest virtual
address) wraps around and the lookup causes a fault on what appears to
be a user space address.

do_page_fault() (thinking it's a fault to a userspace address), tries
to lock mm->mmap_sem.  If the gntdev device is used for the grant map,
m2p_add_override() is called from from gnttab_mmap() with mm->mmap_sem
already locked.  do_page_fault() then deadlocks.

The deadlock would most commonly occur when a 64-bit guest is started
and xenconsoled attempts to grant map its console ring.

Introduce mfn_to_pfn_no_overrides() which checks the MFN is within the
mapped portion of the m2p table before accessing the table and use
this in m2p_add_override(), m2p_remove_override(), and mfn_to_pfn()
(which already had the correct range check).

All faults caused by accessing the non-existant parts of the m2p are
thus within the kernel address space and exception_fixup() is called
without trying to lock mm->mmap_sem.

This means that for MFNs that are outside the mapped range of the m2p
then mfn_to_pfn() will always look in the m2p overrides.  This is
correct because it must be a foreign MFN (and the PFN in the m2p in
this case is only relevant for the other domain).

v3: check for auto_translated_physmap in mfn_to_pfn_no_overrides()
v2: in mfn_to_pfn() look in m2p_overrides if the MFN is out of
    range as it's probably foreign.
