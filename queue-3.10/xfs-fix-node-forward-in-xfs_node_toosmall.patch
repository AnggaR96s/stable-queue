Subject: xfs: fix node forward in xfs_node_toosmall

From: Mark Tinguely <tinguely@sgi.com>

commit 997def25e4b9cee3b01609e18a52f926bca8bd2b upstream.

Commit f5ea1100 cleans up the disk to host conversions for
node directory entries, but because a variable is reused in
xfs_node_toosmall() the next node is not correctly found.
If the original node is small enough (<= 3/8 of the node size),
this change may incorrectly cause a node collapse when it should
not. That will cause an assert in xfstest generic/319:

   Assertion failed: first <= last && last < BBTOB(bp->b_length),
   file: /root/newest/xfs/fs/xfs/xfs_trans_buf.c, line: 569

Keep the original node header to get the correct forward node.

(When a node is considered for a merge with a sibling, it overwrites the
 sibling pointers of the original incore nodehdr with the sibling's
 pointers.  This leads to loop considering the original node as a merge
 candidate with itself in the second pass, and so it incorrectly
 determines a merge should occur.)

[v3: added Dave Chinner's (slightly modified) suggestion to the commit header,
	cleaned up whitespace.  -bpm]
