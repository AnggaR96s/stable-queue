Subject: bridge: Correctly clamp MAX forward_delay when enabling STP

From: Vlad Yasevich <vyasevic@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 4b6c7879d84ad06a2ac5b964808ed599187a188d ]

Commit be4f154d5ef0ca147ab6bcd38857a774133f5450
	bridge: Clamp forward_delay when enabling STP
had a typo when attempting to clamp maximum forward delay.

It is possible to set bridge_forward_delay to be higher then
permitted maximum when STP is off.  When turning STP on, the
higher then allowed delay has to be clamed down to max value.
