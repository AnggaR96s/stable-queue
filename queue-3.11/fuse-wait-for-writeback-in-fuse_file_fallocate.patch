Subject: fuse: wait for writeback in fuse_file_fallocate()

From: Maxim Patlasov <MPatlasov@parallels.com>

commit bde52788bdb755b9e4b75db6c434f30e32a0ca0b upstream.

The patch fixes a race between mmap-ed write and fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE):

1) An user makes a page dirty via mmap-ed write.
2) The user performs fallocate(2) with mode == PUNCH_HOLE|KEEP_SIZE
   and <offset, size> covering the page.
3) Before truncate_pagecache_range call from fuse_file_fallocate,
   the page goes to write-back. The page is fully processed by fuse_writepage
   (including end_page_writeback on the page), but fuse_flush_writepages did
   nothing because fi->writectr < 0.
4) truncate_pagecache_range is called and fuse_file_fallocate is finishing
   by calling fuse_release_nowrite. The latter triggers processing queued
   write-back request which will write stale data to the hole soon.

Changed in v2 (thanks to Brian for suggestion):
 - Do not truncate page cache until FUSE_FALLOCATE succeeded. Otherwise,
   we can end up in returning -ENOTSUPP while user data is already punched
   from page cache. Use filemap_write_and_wait_range() instead.
Changed in v3 (thanks to Miklos for suggestion):
 - fuse_wait_on_writeback() is prone to livelocks; use fuse_set_nowrite()
   instead. So far as we need a dirty-page barrier only, fuse_sync_writes()
   should be enough.
 - rebased to for-linus branch of fuse.git
