Subject: ipc,shm: introduce lockless functions to obtain the ipc object

From: Davidlohr Bueso <davidlohr.bueso@hp.com>

commit 8b8d52ac382b17a19906b930cd69e2edb0aca8ba upstream.

This is the third and final patchset that deals with reducing the amount
of contention we impose on the ipc lock (kern_ipc_perm.lock).  These
changes mostly deal with shared memory, previous work has already been
done for semaphores and message queues:

  http://lkml.org/lkml/2013/3/20/546 (sems)
  http://lkml.org/lkml/2013/5/15/584 (mqueues)

With these patches applied, a custom shm microbenchmark stressing shmctl
doing IPC_STAT with 4 threads a million times, reduces the execution
time by 50%.  A similar run, this time with IPC_SET, reduces the
execution time from 3 mins and 35 secs to 27 seconds.

Patches 1-8: replaces blindly taking the ipc lock for a smarter
combination of rcu and ipc_obtain_object, only acquiring the spinlock
when updating.

Patch 9: renames the ids rw_mutex to rwsem, which is what it already was.

Patch 10: is a trivial mqueue leftover cleanup

Patch 11: adds a brief lock scheme description, requested by Andrew.

This patch:

Add shm_obtain_object() and shm_obtain_object_check(), which will allow us
to get the ipc object without acquiring the lock.  Just as with other
forms of ipc, these functions are basically wrappers around
ipc_obtain_object*().
