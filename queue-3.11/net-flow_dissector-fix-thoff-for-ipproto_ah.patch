Subject: net: flow_dissector: fix thoff for IPPROTO_AH

From: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>

[ Upstream commit b86783587b3d1d552326d955acee37eac48800f1 ]

In commit 8ed781668dd49 ("flow_keys: include thoff into flow_keys for
later usage"), we missed that existing code was using nhoff as a
temporary variable that could not always contain transport header
offset.

This is not a problem for TCP/UDP because port offset (@poff)
is 0 for these protocols.
