Subject: audit: log the audit_names record type

From: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com>

commit d3aea84a4ace5ff9ce7fb7714cee07bebef681c2 upstream.

...to make it clear what the intent behind each record's operation was.

In many cases you can infer this, based on the context of the syscall
and the result. In other cases it's not so obvious. For instance, in
the case where you have a file being renamed over another, you'll have
two different records with the same filename but different inode info.
By logging this information we can clearly tell which one was created
and which was deleted.

This fixes what was broken in commit bfcec708.
Commit 79f6530c should also be backported to stable v3.7+.
