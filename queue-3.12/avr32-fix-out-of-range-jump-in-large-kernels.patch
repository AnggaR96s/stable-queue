Subject: avr32: fix out-of-range jump in large kernels

From: Andreas Bießmann <andreas@biessmann.de>

commit d617b338bbfdd77e9cbd8e7dc949cee3dd73d575 upstream.

This patch fixes following error (for big kernels):

---8<---
arch/avr32/boot/u-boot/head.o: In function `no_tag_table':
(.init.text+0x44): relocation truncated to fit: R_AVR32_22H_PCREL against symbol `panic' defined in .text.unlikely section in kernel/built-in.o
arch/avr32/kernel/built-in.o: In function `bad_return':
(.ex.text+0x236): relocation truncated to fit: R_AVR32_22H_PCREL against symbol `panic' defined in .text.unlikely section in kernel/built-in.o
--->8---

It comes up when the kernel increases and 'panic()' is too far away to fit in
the +/- 2MiB range. Which in turn issues from the 21-bit displacement in
'br{cond4}' mnemonic which is one of the two ways to do jumps (rjmp has just
10-bit displacement and therefore a way smaller range). This fact was stated
before in 8d29b7b9f81d6b83d869ff054e6c189d6da73f1f.
One solution to solve this is to add a local storage for the symbol address
and just load the $pc with that value.
