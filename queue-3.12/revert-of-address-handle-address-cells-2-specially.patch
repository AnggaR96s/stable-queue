Subject: Revert "of/address: Handle #address-cells > 2 specially"

From: Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>

commit 13fcca8f25f4e9ce7f55da9cd353bb743236e212 upstream.

This reverts commit e38c0a1fbc5803cbacdaac0557c70ac8ca5152e7.

Nikita Yushchenko reports:
While trying to make freescale p2020ds and  mpc8572ds boards working
with mainline kernel, I faced that commit e38c0a1f (Handle

Both these boards have uli1575 chip.
Corresponding part in device tree is something like

                uli1575@0 {
                        reg = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0>;
                        #size-cells = <2>;
                        #address-cells = <3>;
                        ranges = <0x2000000 0x0 0x80000000
                                  0x2000000 0x0 0x80000000
                                  0x0 0x20000000

                                  0x1000000 0x0 0x0
                                  0x1000000 0x0 0x0
                                  0x0 0x10000>;
                        isa@1e {
...

I.e. it has #address-cells = <3>

With commit e38c0a1f reverted, devices under uli1575 are registered
correctly, e.g. for rtc

Thierry Reding confirmed this commit was not needed after all:
"We ended up merging a different address representation for Tegra PCIe
and I've confirmed that reverting this commit doesn't cause any obvious
regressions. I think all other drivers in drivers/pci/host ended up
copying what we did on Tegra, so I wouldn't expect any other breakage
either."

There doesn't appear to be a simple way to support both behaviours, so
reverting this as nothing should be depending on the new behaviour.
