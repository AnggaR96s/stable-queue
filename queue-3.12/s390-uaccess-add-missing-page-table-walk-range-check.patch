Subject: s390/uaccess: add missing page table walk range check

From: Heiko Carstens <heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com>

commit 71a86ef055f569b93bc6901f007bdf447dbf515f upstream.

When translating a user space address, the address must be checked against
the ASCE limit of the process. If the address is larger than the maximum
address that is reachable with the ASCE, an ASCE type exception must be
generated.

The current code simply ignored the higher order bits. This resulted in an
address wrap around in user space instead of an exception in user space.
