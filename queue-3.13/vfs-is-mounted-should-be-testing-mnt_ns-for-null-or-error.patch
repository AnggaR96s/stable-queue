Subject: vfs: Is mounted should be testing mnt_ns for NULL or error.

From: "Eric W. Biederman" <ebiederm@xmission.com>

commit 260a459d2e39761fbd39803497205ce1690bc7b1 upstream.

A bug was introduced with the is_mounted helper function in
commit f7a99c5b7c8bd3d3f533c8b38274e33f3da9096e

    get rid of ->mnt_longterm

    it's enough to set ->mnt_ns of internal vfsmounts to something
    distinct from all struct mnt_namespace out there; then we can
    just use the check for ->mnt_ns != NULL in the fast path of
    mntput_no_expire()

The intent was to test if the real_mount(vfsmount)->mnt_ns was
NULL_OR_ERR but the code is actually testing real_mount(vfsmount)
and always returning true.

The result is d_absolute_path returning paths it should be hiding.
