Subject: dm thin: fix race condition when destroying thin pool workqueue

From: Nikolay Borisov <kernel@kyup.com>

commit 18d03e8c25f173f4107a40d0b8c24defb6ed69f3 upstream.

When a thin pool is being destroyed delayed work items are
cancelled using cancel_delayed_work(), which doesn't guarantee that on
return the delayed item isn't running.  This can cause the work item to
requeue itself on an already destroyed workqueue.  Fix this by using
cancel_delayed_work_sync() which guarantees that on return the work item
is not running anymore.

Fixes: 905e51b39a555 ("dm thin: commit outstanding data every second")
Fixes: 85ad643b7e7e5 ("dm thin: add timeout to stop out-of-data-space mode holding IO forever")
