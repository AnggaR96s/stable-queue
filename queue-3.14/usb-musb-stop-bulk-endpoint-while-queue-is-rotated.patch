Subject: usb: musb: Stop bulk endpoint while queue is rotated

From: Andrew Goodbody <andrew.goodbody@cambrionix.com>

commit 7b2c17f829545df27a910e8d82e133c21c9a8c9c upstream.

Ensure that the endpoint is stopped by clearing REQPKT before
clearing DATAERR_NAKTIMEOUT before rotating the queue on the
dedicated bulk endpoint.
This addresses an issue where a race could result in the endpoint
receiving data before it was reprogrammed resulting in a warning
about such data from musb_rx_reinit before it was thrown away.
The data thrown away was a valid packet that had been correctly
ACKed which meant the host and device got out of sync.
