Subject: fs: Fix theoretical division by 0 in super_cache_scan().

From: Tetsuo Handa <penguin-kernel@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp>

commit 475d0db742e3755c6b267f48577ff7cbb7dfda0d upstream.

total_objects could be 0 and is used as a denom.

While total_objects is a "long", total_objects == 0 unlikely happens for
3.12 and later kernels because 32-bit architectures would not be able to
hold (1 << 32) objects. However, total_objects == 0 may happen for kernels
between 3.1 and 3.11 because total_objects in prune_super() was an "int"
and (e.g.) x86_64 architecture might be able to hold (1 << 32) objects.
