Subject: bcache: properly set task state in bch_writeback_thread()

From: Coly Li <colyli@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 99361bbf26337186f02561109c17a4c4b1a7536a ]

Kernel thread routine bch_writeback_thread() has the following code block,

447         down_write(&dc->writeback_lock);
448~450     if (check conditions) {
451                 up_write(&dc->writeback_lock);
452                 set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
453
454                 if (kthread_should_stop())
455                         return 0;
456
457                 schedule();
458                 continue;
459         }

If condition check is true, its task state is set to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
and call schedule() to wait for others to wake up it.

There are 2 issues in current code,
1, Task state is set to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE after the condition checks, if
   another process changes the condition and call wake_up_process(dc->
   writeback_thread), then at line 452 task state is set back to
   TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, the writeback kernel thread will lose a chance to be
   waken up.
2, At line 454 if kthread_should_stop() is true, writeback kernel thread
   will return to kernel/kthread.c:kthread() with TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and
   call do_exit(). It is not good to enter do_exit() with task state
   TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, in following code path might_sleep() is called and a
   warning message is reported by __might_sleep(): "WARNING: do not call
   blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=1 set at [xxxx]".

For the first issue, task state should be set before condition checks.
Ineed because dc->writeback_lock is required when modifying all the
conditions, calling set_current_state() inside code block where dc->
writeback_lock is hold is safe. But this is quite implicit, so I still move
set_current_state() before all the condition checks.

For the second issue, frankley speaking it does not hurt when kernel thread
exits with TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state, but this warning message scares users,
makes them feel there might be something risky with bcache and hurt their
data.  Setting task state to TASK_RUNNING before returning fixes this
problem.

In alloc.c:allocator_wait(), there is also a similar issue, and is also
fixed in this patch.

Changelog:
v3: merge two similar fixes into one patch
v2: fix the race issue in v1 patch.
v1: initial buggy fix.
