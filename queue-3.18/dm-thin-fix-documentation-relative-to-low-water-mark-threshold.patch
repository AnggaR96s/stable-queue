Subject: dm thin: fix documentation relative to low water mark threshold

From: mulhern <amulhern@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 9b28a1102efc75d81298198166ead87d643a29ce ]

Fixes:
1. The use of "exceeds" when the opposite of exceeds, falls below,
was meant.
2. Properly speaking, a table can not exceed a threshold.

It emphasizes the important point, which is that it is the userspace
daemon's responsibility to check for low free space when a device
is resumed, since it won't get a special event indicating low free
space in that situation.
