Subject: lib/rbtree-test: lower default params

[ Upstream commit 0b548e33e6cb2bff240fdaf1783783be15c29080 ]

Fengguang reported soft lockups while running the rbtree and interval
tree test modules.  The logic for these tests all occur in init phase,
and we currently are pounding with the default values for number of
nodes and number of iterations of each test.  Reduce the latter by two
orders of magnitude.  This does not influence the value of the tests in
that one thousand times by default is enough to get the picture.
