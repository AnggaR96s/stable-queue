Subject: media: em28xx: USB bulk packet size fix

From: Brad Love <brad@nextdimension.cc>

[ Upstream commit c7c7e8d7803406daa21e96d00c357de8b77b6764 ]

Hauppauge em28xx bulk devices exhibit continuity errors and corrupted
packets, when run in VMWare virtual machines. Unknown if other
manufacturers bulk models exhibit the same issue. KVM/Qemu is unaffected.

According to documentation the maximum packet multiplier for em28xx in bulk
transfer mode is 256 * 188 bytes. This changes the size of bulk transfers
to maximum supported value and have a bonus beneficial alignment.

Before:

After:

This sets up USB to expect just as many bytes as the em28xx is set to emit.

Successful usage under load afterwards natively and in both VMWare
and KVM/Qemu virtual machines.
