Subject: serial: omap: fix runtime-pm handling on unbind

From: Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>

commit 099bd73dc17ed77aa8c98323e043613b6e8f54fc upstream.

An unbalanced and misplaced synchronous put was used to suspend the
device on driver unbind, something which with a likewise misplaced
pm_runtime_disable leads to external aborts when an open port is being
removed.

Unhandled fault: external abort on non-linefetch (0x1028) at 0xfa024010

Fix this up by resuming the device before deregistering the port and by
suspending and disabling runtime pm only after the port has been
removed.

Also make sure to disable autosuspend before disabling runtime pm so
that the usage count is balanced and device actually suspended before
returning.

Note that due to a negative autosuspend delay being set in probe, the
unbalanced put would actually suspend the device on first driver unbind,
while rebinding and again unbinding would result in a negative
power.usage_count.
