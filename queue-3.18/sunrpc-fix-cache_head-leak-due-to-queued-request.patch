Subject: sunrpc: fix cache_head leak due to queued request

From: Vasily Averin <vvs@virtuozzo.com>

commit 4ecd55ea074217473f94cfee21bb72864d39f8d7 upstream.

After commit d202cce8963d, an expired cache_head can be removed from the
cache_detail's hash.

However, the expired cache_head may be waiting for a reply from a
previously submitted request. Such a cache_head has an increased
refcounter and therefore it won't be freed after cache_put(freeme).

Because the cache_head was removed from the hash it cannot be found
during cache_clean() and can be leaked forever, together with stalled
cache_request and other taken resources.

In our case we noticed it because an entry in the export cache was
holding a reference on a filesystem.

Fixes d202cce8963d ("sunrpc: never return expired entries in sunrpc_cache_lookup")
