Subject: mm: when stealing freepages, also take pages created by splitting buddy page

From: Vlastimil Babka <vbabka@suse.cz>

commit 99592d598eca62bdbbf62b59941c189176dfc614 upstream.

When studying page stealing, I noticed some weird looking decisions in
try_to_steal_freepages().  The first I assume is a bug (Patch 1), the
following two patches were driven by evaluation.

Testing was done with stress-highalloc of mmtests, using the
mm_page_alloc_extfrag tracepoint and postprocessing to get counts of how
often page stealing occurs for individual migratetypes, and what
migratetypes are used for fallbacks.  Arguably, the worst case of page
stealing is when UNMOVABLE allocation steals from MOVABLE pageblock.
RECLAIMABLE allocation stealing from MOVABLE allocation is also not ideal,
so the goal is to minimize these two cases.

The evaluation of v2 wasn't always clear win and Joonsoo questioned the
results.  Here I used different baseline which includes RFC compaction
improvements from [1].  I found that the compaction improvements reduce
variability of stress-highalloc, so there's less noise in the data.

First, let's look at stress-highalloc configured to do sync compaction,
and how these patches reduce page stealing events during the test.  First
column is after fresh reboot, other two are reiterations of test without
reboot.  That was all accumulater over 5 re-iterations (so the benchmark
was run 5x3 times with 5 fresh restarts).

In v2 we've seen apparent regression with Patch 1 for unmovable events,
this is now gone, suggesting it was indeed noise.  Here, each patch
improves the situation for unmovable events.  Reclaimable is improved by
patch 1 and then either the same modulo noise, or perhaps sligtly worse -
a small price for unmovable improvements, IMHO.  The number of movable
allocations falling back to other migratetypes is most noisy, but it's
reduced to half at Patch 2 nevertheless.  These are least critical as
compaction can move them around.

If we look at success rates, the patches don't affect them, that didn't change.

While there's no improvement here, I consider reduced fragmentation events
to be worth on its own.  Patch 2 also seems to reduce scanning for free
pages, and migrations in compaction, suggesting it has somewhat less work

As with v2, /proc/pagetypeinfo appears unaffected with respect to numbers
of unmovable and reclaimable pageblocks.

Configuring the benchmark to allocate like THP page fault (i.e.  no sync
compaction) gives much noisier results for iterations 2 and 3 after
reboot.  This is not so surprising given how [1] offers lower improvements
in this scenario due to less restarts after deferred compaction which
would change compaction pivot.

The improvements for first iteration are clear, the rest is much noisier
and can appear like regression for Patch 1.  Anyway, patch 2 rectifies it.

Allocation success rates are again unaffected so there's no point in
making this e-mail any longer.

This patch (of 3):

When __rmqueue_fallback() is called to allocate a page of order X, it will
find a page of order Y >= X of a fallback migratetype, which is different
from the desired migratetype.  With the help of try_to_steal_freepages(),
it may change the migratetype (to the desired one) also of:

1) all currently free pages in the pageblock containing the fallback page
2) the fallback pageblock itself
3) buddy pages created by splitting the fallback page (when Y > X)

These decisions take the order Y into account, as well as the desired
migratetype, with the goal of preventing multiple fallback allocations
that could e.g.  distribute UNMOVABLE allocations among multiple
pageblocks.

Originally, decision for 1) has implied the decision for 3).  Commit
47118af076f6 ("mm: mmzone: MIGRATE_CMA migration type added") changed that
(probably unintentionally) so that the buddy pages in case 3) are always
changed to the desired migratetype, except for CMA pageblocks.

Commit fef903efcf0c ("mm/page_allo.c: restructure free-page stealing code
and fix a bug") did some refactoring and added a comment that the case of
3) is intended.  Commit 0cbef29a7821 ("mm: __rmqueue_fallback() should
respect pageblock type") removed the comment and tried to restore the
original behavior where 1) implies 3), but due to the previous
refactoring, the result is instead that only 2) implies 3) - and the
conditions for 2) are less frequently met than conditions for 1).  This
may increase fragmentation in situations where the code decides to steal
all free pages from the pageblock (case 1)), but then gives back the buddy
pages produced by splitting.

This patch restores the original intended logic where 1) implies 3).
During testing with stress-highalloc from mmtests, this has shown to
decrease the number of events where UNMOVABLE and RECLAIMABLE allocations
steal from MOVABLE pageblocks, which can lead to permanent fragmentation.
In some cases it has increased the number of events when MOVABLE
allocations steal from UNMOVABLE or RECLAIMABLE pageblocks, but these are
fixable by sync compaction and thus less harmful.

Note that evaluation has shown that the behavior introduced by
47118af076f6 for buddy pages in case 3) is actually even better than the
original logic, so the following patch will introduce it properly once
again.  For stable backports of this patch it makes thus sense to only fix
versions containing 0cbef29a7821.
