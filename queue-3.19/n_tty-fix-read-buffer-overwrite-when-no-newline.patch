Subject: n_tty: Fix read buffer overwrite when no newline

From: Peter Hurley <peter@hurleysoftware.com>

commit fb5ef9e7da39968fec6d6f37f20a23d23740c75e upstream.

In canon mode, the read buffer head will advance over the buffer tail
if the input > 4095 bytes without receiving a line termination char.

Discard additional input until a line termination is received.
Before evaluating for overflow, the 'room' value is normalized for
I_PARMRK and 1 byte is reserved for line termination (even in !icanon
mode, in case the mode is switched). The following table shows the
transform:

 actual buffer |  'room' value before overflow calc
  space avail  |    !I_PARMRK    |    I_PARMRK
 --------------------------------------------------
      0        |       -1        |       -1
      1        |        0        |        0
      2        |        1        |        0
      3        |        2        |        0
      4+       |        3        |        1

When !icanon or when icanon and the read buffer contains newlines,
normalized 'room' values of -1 and 0 are clamped to 0, and
'overflow' is 0, so read_head is not adjusted and the input i/o loop
exits (setting no_room if called from flush_to_ldisc()). No input
is discarded since the reader does have input available to read
which ensures forward progress.

When icanon and the read buffer does not contain newlines and the
normalized 'room' value is 0, then overflow and room are reset to 1,
so that the i/o loop will process the next input char normally
(except for parity errors which are ignored). Thus, erasures, signalling
chars, 7-bit mode, etc. will continue to be handled properly.

If the input char processed was not a line termination char, then
the canon_head index will not have advanced, so the normalized 'room'
value will now be -1 and 'overflow' will be set, which indicates the
read_head can safely be reset, effectively erasing the last char
processed.

If the input char processed was a line termination, then the
canon_head index will have advanced, so 'overflow' is cleared to 0,
the read_head is not reset, and 'room' is cleared to 0, which exits
the i/o loop (because the reader now have input available to read
which ensures forward progress).

Note that it is possible for a line termination to be received, and
for the reader to copy the line to the user buffer before the
input i/o loop is ready to process the next input char. This is
why the i/o loop recomputes the room/overflow state with every
input char while handling overflow.

Finally, if the input data was processed without receiving
a line termination (so that overflow is still set), the pty
driver must receive a write wakeup. A pty writer may be waiting
to write more data in n_tty_write() but without unthrottling
here that wakeup will not arrive, and forward progress will halt.
(Normally, the pty writer is woken when the reader reads data out
of the buffer and more space become available).
