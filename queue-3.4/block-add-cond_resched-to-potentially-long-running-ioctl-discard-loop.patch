Subject: block: add cond_resched() to potentially long running ioctl discard loop

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@fb.com>

commit c8123f8c9cb517403b51aa41c3c46ff5e10b2c17 upstream.

When mkfs issues a full device discard and the device only
supports discards of a smallish size, we can loop in
blkdev_issue_discard() for a long time. If preempt isn't enabled,
this can turn into a softlock situation and the kernel will
start complaining.

Add an explicit cond_resched() at the end of the loop to avoid
that.
