partial of commit 8e8b41f9d8c8e63fc92f899ace8da91a490ac573 upstream.

As part of commit 463454b5dbd8 ("cfg80211: fix interface
combinations check"), this extra check was introduced:

       if ((all_iftypes & used_iftypes) != used_iftypes)
               goto cont;

However, most wireless NIC drivers did not advertise ADHOC in
wiphy.iface_combinations[i].limits[] and hence we'll get -EBUSY
when we bring up a ADHOC wlan with commands similar to:

 # iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc && ifconfig wlan0 up

In commit 8e8b41f9d8c8e ("cfg80211: enforce lack of interface
combinations"), the change below fixes the issue:

       if (total == 1)
               return 0;

But it also introduces other dependencies for stable. For example,
a full cherry pick of 8e8b41f9d8c8e would introduce additional
regressions unless we also start cherry picking driver specific
fixes like the following:

  9b4760e  ath5k: add possible wiphy interface combinations
  1ae2fc2  mac80211_hwsim: advertise interface combinations
  20c8e8d  ath9k: add possible wiphy interface combinations

And the purpose of the 'if (total == 1)' is to cover the specific
use case (IBSS, adhoc) that was mentioned above. So we just pick
the specific part out from 8e8b41f9d8c8e here.

Doing so gives stable kernels a way to fix the change introduced
by 463454b5dbd8, without having to make cherry picks specific to
various NIC drivers.
