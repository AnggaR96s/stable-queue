Subject: cgroup: notify_on_release may not be triggered in some cases

From: Daisuke Nishimura <nishimura@mxp.nes.nec.co.jp>

commit 1f5320d5972aa50d3e8d2b227b636b370e608359 upstream.

notify_on_release must be triggered when the last process in a cgroup is
move to another. But if the first(and only) process in a cgroup is moved to
another, notify_on_release is not triggered.

	# mkdir /cgroup/cpu/SRC
	# mkdir /cgroup/cpu/DST
	#
	# echo 1 >/cgroup/cpu/SRC/notify_on_release
	# echo 1 >/cgroup/cpu/DST/notify_on_release
	#
	# sleep 300 &
	[1] 8629
	#
	# echo 8629 >/cgroup/cpu/SRC/tasks
	# echo 8629 >/cgroup/cpu/DST/tasks
	-> notify_on_release for /SRC must be triggered at this point,
	   but it isn't.

This is because put_css_set() is called before setting CGRP_RELEASABLE
in cgroup_task_migrate(), and is a regression introduce by the
commit:74a1166d(cgroups: make procs file writable), which was merged
into v3.0.
