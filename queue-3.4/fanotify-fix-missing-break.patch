Subject: fanotify: fix missing break

From: Eric Paris <eparis@redhat.com>

commit 848561d368751a1c0f679b9f045a02944506a801 upstream.

Anders Blomdell noted in 2010 that Fanotify lost events and provided a
test case.  Eric Paris confirmed it was a bug and posted a fix to the
list

  https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/linux.kernel/RrJfTfyW2BE

but never applied it.  Repeated attempts over time to actually get him
to apply it have never had a reply from anyone who has raised it

So apply it anyway
