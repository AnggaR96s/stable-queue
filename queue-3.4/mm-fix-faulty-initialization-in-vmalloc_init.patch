Subject: mm: fix faulty initialization in vmalloc_init()

From: KyongHo <pullip.cho@samsung.com>

commit dbda591d920b4c7692725b13e3f68ecb251e9080 upstream.

The transfer of ->flags causes some of the static mapping virtual
addresses to be prematurely freed (before the mapping is removed) because
VM_LAZY_FREE gets "set" if tmp->flags has VM_IOREMAP set.  This might
cause subsequent vmalloc/ioremap calls to fail because it might allocate
one of the freed virtual address ranges that aren't unmapped.

va->flags has different types of flags from tmp->flags.  If a region with
VM_IOREMAP set is registered with vm_area_add_early(), it will be removed
by __purge_vmap_area_lazy().

Fix vmalloc_init() to correctly initialize vmap_area for the given
vm_struct.

Also initialise va->vm.  If it is not set, find_vm_area() for the early
vm regions will always fail.
