Subject: nilfs2: fix segctor bug that causes file system corruption

From: Andreas Rohner <andreas.rohner@gmx.net>

commit 70f2fe3a26248724d8a5019681a869abdaf3e89a upstream.

There is a bug in the function nilfs_segctor_collect, which results in
active data being written to a segment, that is marked as clean.  It is
possible, that this segment is selected for a later segment
construction, whereby the old data is overwritten.

The problem shows itself with the following kernel log message:

  nilfs_sufile_do_cancel_free: segment 6533 must be clean

Usually a few hours later the file system gets corrupted:

  NILFS: bad btree node (blocknr=8748107): level = 0, flags = 0x0, nchildren = 0
  NILFS error (device sdc1): nilfs_bmap_last_key: broken bmap (inode number=114660)

The issue can be reproduced with a file system that is nearly full and
with the cleaner running, while some IO intensive task is running.
Although it is quite hard to reproduce.

This is what happens:

 1. The cleaner starts the segment construction
 2. nilfs_segctor_collect is called
 3. sc_stage is on NILFS_ST_SUFILE and segments are freed
 4. sc_stage is on NILFS_ST_DAT current segment is full
 5. nilfs_segctor_extend_segments is called, which
    allocates a new segment
 6. The new segment is one of the segments freed in step 3
 7. nilfs_sufile_cancel_freev is called and produces an error message
 8. Loop around and the collection starts again
 9. sc_stage is on NILFS_ST_SUFILE and segments are freed
    including the newly allocated segment, which will contain active
    data and can be allocated at a later time
10. A few hours later another segment construction allocates the
    segment and causes file system corruption

This can be prevented by simply reordering the statements.  If
nilfs_sufile_cancel_freev is called before nilfs_segctor_extend_segments
the freed segments are marked as dirty and cannot be allocated any more.
