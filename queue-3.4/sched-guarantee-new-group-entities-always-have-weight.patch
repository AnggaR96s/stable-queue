Subject: sched: Guarantee new group-entities always have weight

From: Paul Turner <pjt@google.com>

commit 0ac9b1c21874d2490331233b3242085f8151e166 upstream.

Currently, group entity load-weights are initialized to zero. This
admits some races with respect to the first time they are re-weighted in
earlty use. ( Let g[x] denote the se for "g" on cpu "x". )

Suppose that we have root->a and that a enters a throttled state,
immediately followed by a[0]->t1 (the only task running on cpu[0])
blocking:

  put_prev_task(group_cfs_rq(a[0]), t1)
  put_prev_entity(..., t1)
  check_cfs_rq_runtime(group_cfs_rq(a[0]))
  throttle_cfs_rq(group_cfs_rq(a[0]))

Then, before unthrottling occurs, let a[0]->b[0]->t2 wake for the first
time:

  enqueue_task_fair(rq[0], t2)
  enqueue_entity(group_cfs_rq(b[0]), t2)
  enqueue_entity_load_avg(group_cfs_rq(b[0]), t2)
  account_entity_enqueue(group_cfs_ra(b[0]), t2)
  update_cfs_shares(group_cfs_rq(b[0]))
  < skipped because b is part of a throttled hierarchy >
  enqueue_entity(group_cfs_rq(a[0]), b[0])
  ...

We now have b[0] enqueued, yet group_cfs_rq(a[0])->load.weight == 0
which violates invariants in several code-paths. Eliminate the
possibility of this by initializing group entity weight.
