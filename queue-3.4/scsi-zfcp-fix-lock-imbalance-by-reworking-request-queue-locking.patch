Subject: SCSI: zfcp: fix lock imbalance by reworking request queue locking

From: Martin Peschke <mpeschke@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit d79ff142624e1be080ad8d09101f7004d79c36e1 upstream.

This patch adds wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout(), which is a
straight-forward descendant of wait_event_interruptible_timeout() and
wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq().

The zfcp driver used to call wait_event_interruptible_timeout()
in combination with some intricate and error-prone locking. Using
wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout() as a replacement
nicely cleans up that locking.

This rework removes a situation that resulted in a locking imbalance
in zfcp_qdio_sbal_get():

BUG: workqueue leaked lock or atomic: events/1/0xffffff00/10
    last function: zfcp_fc_wka_port_offline+0x0/0xa0 [zfcp]

It was introduced by commit c2af7545aaff3495d9bf9a7608c52f0af86fb194
"[SCSI] zfcp: Do not wait for SBALs on stopped queue", which had a new
code path related to ZFCP_STATUS_ADAPTER_QDIOUP that took an early exit
without a required lock being held. The problem occured when a
special, non-SCSI I/O request was being submitted in process context,
when the adapter's queues had been torn down. In this case the bug
surfaced when the Fibre Channel port connection for a well-known address
was closed during a concurrent adapter shut-down procedure, which is a
rare constellation.

This patch also fixes these warnings from the sparse tool (make C=1):

drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_qdio.c:224:12: warning: context imbalance in
 'zfcp_qdio_sbal_check' - wrong count at exit
drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_qdio.c:244:5: warning: context imbalance in
 'zfcp_qdio_sbal_get' - unexpected unlock

Last but not least, we get rid of that crappy lock-unlock-lock
sequence at the beginning of the critical section.

It is okay to call zfcp_erp_adapter_reopen() with req_q_lock held.
