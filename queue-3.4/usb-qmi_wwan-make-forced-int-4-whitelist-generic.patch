Subject: USB: qmi_wwan: Make forced int 4 whitelist generic

commit 00001880cd8faaa349fe2ebb158f7e0cd8026048 upstream.

Change the forced interface 4 whitelist to use the generic shared
binder instead of the Gobi specific one. Certain ZTE devices
(K3520-Z & K3765-Z) don't work with the Gobi version, but function
quite happily with the generic. This has been tested with the following
devices:
K3520-Z
K3565-Z
K3765-Z
K4505-Z
It hasn't been tested with the ZTE MF820D, which is the only other
device that uses this whitelist at present. Although Bjorn doesn't
expect any problems, any testing with that device would be appreciated.
