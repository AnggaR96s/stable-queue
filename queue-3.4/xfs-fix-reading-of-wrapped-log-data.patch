Subject: xfs: fix reading of wrapped log data

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

commit 6ce377afd1755eae5c93410ca9a1121dfead7b87 upstream.

Commit 4439647 ("xfs: reset buffer pointers before freeing them") in
3.0-rc1 introduced a regression when recovering log buffers that
wrapped around the end of log. The second part of the log buffer at
the start of the physical log was being read into the header buffer
rather than the data buffer, and hence recovery was seeing garbage
in the data buffer when it got to the region of the log buffer that
was incorrectly read.
