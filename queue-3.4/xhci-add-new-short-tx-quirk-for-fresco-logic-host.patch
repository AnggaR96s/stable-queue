Subject: xhci: Add new short TX quirk for Fresco Logic host.

From: Sarah Sharp <sarah.a.sharp@linux.intel.com>

commit 1530bbc6272d9da1e39ef8e06190d42c13a02733 upstream.

Sergio reported that when he recorded audio from a USB headset mic
plugged into the USB 3.0 port on his ASUS N53SV-DH72, the audio sounded
"robotic".  When plugged into the USB 2.0 port under EHCI on the same
laptop, the audio sounded fine.  The device is:

Bus 002 Device 004: ID 046d:0a0c Logitech, Inc. Clear Chat Comfort USB Headset

The problem was tracked down to the Fresco Logic xHCI host controller
not correctly reporting short transfers on isochronous IN endpoints.
The driver would submit a 96 byte transfer, the device would only send
88 or 90 bytes, and the xHCI host would report the transfer had a
"successful" completion code, with an untransferred buffer length of 8
or 6 bytes.

The successful completion code and non-zero untransferred length is a
contradiction.  The xHCI host is supposed to only mark a transfer as
successful if all the bytes are transferred.  Otherwise, the transfer
should be marked with a short packet completion code.  Without the EHCI
bus trace, we wouldn't know whether the xHCI driver should trust the
completion code or the untransferred length.  With it, we know to trust
the untransferred length.

Add a new xHCI quirk for the Fresco Logic host controller.  If a
transfer is reported as successful, but the untransferred length is
non-zero, print a warning.  For the Fresco Logic host, change the
completion code to COMP_SHORT_TX and process the transfer like a short
transfer.

This should be backported to stable kernels that contain the commit
f5182b4155b9d686c5540a6822486400e34ddd98 "xhci: Disable MSI for some
Fresco Logic hosts."  That commit was marked for stable kernels as old
as 2.6.36.
