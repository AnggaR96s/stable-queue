Subject: nfsv3: Make v3 mounts fail with ETIMEDOUTs instead EIO on mountd timeouts

From: Scott Mayhew <smayhew@redhat.com>

commit acce94e68a0f346115fd41cdc298197d2d5a59ad upstream.

In very busy v3 environment, rpc.mountd can respond to the NULL
procedure but not the MNT procedure in a timely manner causing
the MNT procedure to time out. The problem is the mount system
call returns EIO which causes the mount to fail, instead of
ETIMEDOUT, which would cause the mount to be retried.

This patch sets the RPC_TASK_SOFT|RPC_TASK_TIMEOUT flags to
the rpc_call_sync() call in nfs_mount() which causes
ETIMEDOUT to be returned on timed out connections.
