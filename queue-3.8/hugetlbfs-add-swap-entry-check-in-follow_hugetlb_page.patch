Subject: hugetlbfs: add swap entry check in follow_hugetlb_page()

From: Naoya Horiguchi <n-horiguchi@ah.jp.nec.com>

commit 9cc3a5bd40067b9a0fbd49199d0780463fc2140f upstream.

With applying the previous patch "hugetlbfs: stop setting VM_DONTDUMP in
initializing vma(VM_HUGETLB)" to reenable hugepage coredump, if a memory
error happens on a hugepage and the affected processes try to access the
error hugepage, we hit VM_BUG_ON(atomic_read(&page->_count) <= 0) in
get_page().

The reason for this bug is that coredump-related code doesn't recognise
"hugepage hwpoison entry" with which a pmd entry is replaced when a memory
error occurs on a hugepage.

In other words, physical address information is stored in different bit
layout between hugepage hwpoison entry and pmd entry, so
follow_hugetlb_page() which is called in get_dump_page() returns a wrong
page from a given address.

The expected behavior is like this:

  absent   is_swap_pte   FOLL_DUMP   Expected behavior
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
   true     false         false       hugetlb_fault
   false    true          false       hugetlb_fault
   false    false         false       return page
   true     false         true        skip page (to avoid allocation)
   false    true          true        hugetlb_fault
   false    false         true        return page

With this patch, we can call hugetlb_fault() and take proper actions (we
wait for migration entries, fail with VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE for
hwpoisoned entries,) and as the result we can dump all hugepages except
for hwpoisoned ones.
