Subject: rtlwifi: rtl8192cu: Fix duplicate if test

From: Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>

commit 10d0b9030a3f86e1e26c710c7580524d7787d688 upstream.

A typo causes routine rtl92cu_phy_rf6052_set_cck_txpower() to test the
same condition twice. The problem was found using cppcheck-1.49, and the
proper fix was verified against the pre-mac80211 version of the code.

This patch was originally included as commit 1288aa4, but was accidentally
reverted in a later patch.
