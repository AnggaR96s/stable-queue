Subject: swap: avoid read_swap_cache_async() race to deadlock while waiting on discard I/O completion

From: Rafael Aquini <aquini@redhat.com>

commit cbab0e4eec299e9059199ebe6daf48730be46d2b upstream.

read_swap_cache_async() can race against get_swap_page(), and stumble
across a SWAP_HAS_CACHE entry in the swap map whose page wasn't brought
into the swapcache yet.

This transient swap_map state is expected to be transitory, but the
actual placement of discard at scan_swap_map() inserts a wait for I/O
completion thus making the thread at read_swap_cache_async() to loop
around its -EEXIST case, while the other end at get_swap_page() is
scheduled away at scan_swap_map().  This can leave the system deadlocked
if the I/O completion happens to be waiting on the CPU waitqueue where
read_swap_cache_async() is busy looping and !CONFIG_PREEMPT.

This patch introduces a cond_resched() call to make the aforementioned
read_swap_cache_async() busy loop condition to bail out when necessary,
thus avoiding the subtle race window.
