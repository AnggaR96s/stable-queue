Subject: gso: Validate assumption of frag_list segementation

From: Ilan Tayari <ilant@mellanox.com>


[ Upstream commit 43170c4e0ba709c79130c3fe5a41e66279950cd0 ]

Commit 07b26c9454a2 ("gso: Support partial splitting at the frag_list
pointer") assumes that all SKBs in a frag_list (except maybe the last
one) contain the same amount of GSO payload.

This assumption is not always correct, resulting in the following
warning message in the log:
    skb_segment: too many frags

For example, mlx5 driver in Striding RQ mode creates some RX SKBs with
one frag, and some with 2 frags.
After GRO, the frag_list SKBs end up having different amounts of payload.
If this frag_list SKB is then forwarded, the aforementioned assumption
is violated.

Validate the assumption, and fall back to software GSO if it not true.
