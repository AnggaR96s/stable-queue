Subject: libata: reject passthrough WRITE SAME requests

From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

commit c6ade20f5e50e188d20b711a618b20dd1d50457e upstream.

The WRITE SAME to TRIM translation rewrites the DATA OUT buffer.  While
the SCSI code accomodates for this by passing a read-writable buffer
userspace applications don't cater for this behavior.  In fact it can
be used to rewrite e.g. a readonly file through mmap and should be
considered as a security fix.
