Subject: tpm: Issue a TPM2_Shutdown for TPM2 devices.

From: Josh Zimmerman <joshz@google.com>

commit d1bd4a792d3961a04e6154118816b00167aad91a upstream.

If a TPM2 loses power without a TPM2_Shutdown command being issued (a
"disorderly reboot"), it may lose some state that has yet to be
persisted to NVRam, and will increment the DA counter. After the DA
counter gets sufficiently large, the TPM will lock the user out.

NOTE: This only changes behavior on TPM2 devices. Since TPM1 uses sysfs,
and sysfs relies on implicit locking on chip->ops, it is not safe to
allow this code to run in TPM1, or to add sysfs support to TPM2, until
that locking is made explicit.
