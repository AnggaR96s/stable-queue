[ Upstream commit d3c8e2c5757153bbfad70019ec1decbca86f3def ]

There is no such property in the SPI controller binding documentation.
Also Linux driver doesn't look for it.

This fixes:
arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm4708-asus-rt-ac56u.dtb: spi@18029200: Unevaluated properties are not allowed ('clock-names' was unexpected)
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/brcm,spi-bcm-qspi.yaml
