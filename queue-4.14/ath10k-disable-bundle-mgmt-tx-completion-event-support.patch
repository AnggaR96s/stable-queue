Subject: ath10k: disable bundle mgmt tx completion event support

From: Surabhi Vishnoi <svishnoi@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit 673bc519c55843c68c3aecff71a4101e79d28d2b ]

The tx completion of multiple mgmt frames can be bundled
in a single event and sent by the firmware to host, if this
capability is not disabled explicitly by the host. If the host
cannot handle the bundled mgmt tx completion, this capability
support needs to be disabled in the wmi init cmd, sent to the firmware.

Add the host capability indication flag in the wmi ready command,
to let firmware know the features supported by the host driver.
This field is ignored if it is not supported by firmware.

Set the host capability indication flag(i.e. host_capab) to zero,
for disabling the support of bundle mgmt tx completion. This will
indicate the firmware to send completion event for every mgmt tx
completion, instead of bundling them together and sending in a single
event.

Tested HW: WCN3990
Tested FW: WLAN.HL.2.0-01188-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1
