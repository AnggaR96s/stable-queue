Subject: compiler.h: Allow arch-specific asm/compiler.h

[ Upstream commit 04f264d3a8b0eb25d378127bd78c3c9a0261c828 ]

We have a need to override the definition of
barrier_before_unreachable() for MIPS, which means we either need to add
architecture-specific code into linux/compiler-gcc.h or we need to allow
the architecture to provide a header that can define the macro before
the generic definition. The latter seems like the better approach.

A straightforward approach to the per-arch header is to make use of
asm-generic to provide a default empty header & adjust architectures
which don't need anything specific to make use of that by adding the
header to generic-y. Unfortunately this doesn't work so well due to
commit 28128c61e08e ("kconfig.h: Include compiler types to avoid missed
struct attributes") which caused linux/compiler_types.h to be included
in the compilation of every C file via the -include linux/kconfig.h flag
in c_flags.

Because the -include flag is present for all C files we compile, we need
the architecture-provided header to be present before any C files are
compiled. If any C files can be compiled prior to the asm-generic header
wrappers being generated then we hit a build failure due to missing
header. Such cases do exist - one pointed out by the kbuild test robot
is the compilation of arch/ia64/kernel/nr-irqs.c, which occurs as part
of the archprepare target [1].

This leaves us with a few options:

  1) Use generic-y & fix any build failures we find by enforcing
     ordering such that the asm-generic target occurs before any C
     compilation, such that linux/compiler_types.h can always include
     the generated asm-generic wrapper which in turn includes the empty
     asm-generic header. This would rely on us finding all the
     problematic cases - I don't know for sure that the ia64 issue is
     the only one.

  2) Add an actual empty header to each architecture, so that we don't
     need the generated asm-generic wrapper. This seems messy.

  3) Give up & add #ifdef CONFIG_MIPS or similar to
     linux/compiler_types.h. This seems messy too.

  4) Include the arch header only when it's actually needed, removing
     the need for the asm-generic wrapper for all other architectures.

This patch allows us to use approach 4, by including an asm/compiler.h
header from linux/compiler_types.h after the inclusion of the
compiler-specific linux/compiler-*.h header(s). We do this
conditionally, only when CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_COMPILER_H is selected, in
order to avoid the need for asm-generic wrappers & the associated build
ordering issue described above. The asm/compiler.h header is included
after the generic linux/compiler-*.h header(s) for consistency with the
way linux/compiler-intel.h & linux/compiler-clang.h are included after
the linux/compiler-gcc.h header that they override.
