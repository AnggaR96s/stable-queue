Subject: dpaa_eth: fix pause capability advertisement logic

From: Jake Moroni <mail@jakemoroni.com>

[ Upstream commit 3021efb440d02bf5b952b6d151c7ffee9bdd49fe ]

The ADVERTISED_Asym_Pause bit was being improperly set when both
rx and tx pause were enabled. When rx and tx are both enabled, only
the ADVERTISED_Pause bit is supposed to be set.
