Subject: HID: sony: Fix memory corruption issue on cleanup.

From: Roderick Colenbrander <roderick.colenbrander@sony.com>

commit 2bcdacb70327013ca2066bfcf2af1009eff01f1d upstream.

The sony driver is not properly cleaning up from potential failures in
sony_input_configured. Currently it calls hid_hw_stop, while hid_connect
is still running. This is not a good idea, instead hid_hw_stop should
be moved to sony_probe. Similar changes were recently made to Logitech
drivers, which were also doing improper cleanup.
