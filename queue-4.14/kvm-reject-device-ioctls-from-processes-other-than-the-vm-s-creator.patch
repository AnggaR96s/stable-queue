Subject: KVM: Reject device ioctls from processes other than the VM's creator

From: Sean Christopherson <sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>

commit ddba91801aeb5c160b660caed1800eb3aef403f8 upstream.

KVM's API requires thats ioctls must be issued from the same process
that created the VM.  In other words, userspace can play games with a
VM's file descriptors, e.g. fork(), SCM_RIGHTS, etc..., but only the
creator can do anything useful.  Explicitly reject device ioctls that
are issued by a process other than the VM's creator, and update KVM's
API documentation to extend its requirements to device ioctls.
