Subject: md raid10: fix NULL deference in handle_write_completed()

From: Yufen Yu <yuyufen@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 01a69cab01c184d3786af09e9339311123d63d22 ]

In the case of 'recover', an r10bio with R10BIO_WriteError &
R10BIO_IsRecover will be progressed by handle_write_completed().
This function traverses all r10bio->devs[copies].
If devs[m].repl_bio != NULL, it thinks conf->mirrors[dev].replacement
is also not NULL. However, this is not always true.

When there is an rdev of raid10 has replacement, then each r10bio
->devs[m].repl_bio != NULL in conf->r10buf_pool. However, in 'recover',
even if corresponded replacement is NULL, it doesn't clear r10bio
->devs[m].repl_bio, resulting in replacement NULL deference.

This bug was introduced when replacement support for raid10 was
added in Linux 3.3.

As NeilBrown suggested:
	Elsewhere the determination of "is this device part of the
	resync/recovery" is made by resting bio->bi_end_io.
	If this is end_sync_write, then we tried to write here.
	If it is NULL, then we didn't try to write.
