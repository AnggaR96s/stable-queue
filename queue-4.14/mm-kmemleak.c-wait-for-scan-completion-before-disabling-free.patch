Subject: mm/kmemleak.c: wait for scan completion before disabling free

From: Vinayak Menon <vinmenon@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit 914b6dfff790544d9b77dfd1723adb3745ec9700 ]

A crash is observed when kmemleak_scan accesses the object->pointer,
likely due to the following race.

  TASK A             TASK B                     TASK C
  kmemleak_write
   (with "scan" and
   NOT "scan=on")
  kmemleak_scan()
                     create_object
                     kmem_cache_alloc fails
                     kmemleak_disable
                     kmemleak_do_cleanup
                     kmemleak_free_enabled = 0
                                                kfree
                                                kmemleak_free bails out
                                                 (kmemleak_free_enabled is 0)
                                                slub frees object->pointer
  update_checksum
  crash - object->pointer
   freed (DEBUG_PAGEALLOC)

kmemleak_do_cleanup waits for the scan thread to complete, but not for
direct call to kmemleak_scan via kmemleak_write.  So add a wait for
kmemleak_scan completion before disabling kmemleak_free, and while at it
fix the comment on stop_scan_thread.
