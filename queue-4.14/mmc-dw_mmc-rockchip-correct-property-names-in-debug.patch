Subject: mmc: dw_mmc-rockchip: correct property names in debug

[ Upstream commit e988867fd774d00aeaf5d3c332032bf5b97a4147 ]

Following up the device tree fixed in commits e78c637127ee ("ARM: dts:
rockchip: Fix DWMMC clocks") and ca9eee95a2de ("arm64: dts: rockchip:
Fix DWMMC clocks", 2018-02-15), avoid confusion by using the correct
property name in the debug output if clocks are not found.
