Subject: s390/dasd: fix handling of internal requests

From: Stefan Haberland <sth@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit 9487cfd3430d07366801886bdf185799a2b6f066 ]

Internal DASD device driver I/O such as query host access count or
path verification is started using the _sleep_on() function.
To mark a request as started or ended the callback_data is set to either
DASD_SLEEPON_START_TAG or DASD_SLEEPON_END_TAG.

In cases where the request has to be stopped unconditionally the status is
set to DASD_SLEEPON_END_TAG as well which leads to immediate clearing of
the request.
But the request might still be on a device request queue for normal
operation which might lead to a panic because of a BUG() statement in
__dasd_device_process_final_queue() or a list corruption of the device
request queue.

Fix by removing the setting of DASD_SLEEPON_END_TAG in the
dasd_cancel_req() and dasd_generic_requeue_all_requests() functions and
ensure that the request is not deleted in the requeue function.
Trigger the device tasklet in the requeue function and let the normal
processing cleanup the request.
