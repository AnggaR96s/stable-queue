Subject: tipc: fix flow control accounting for implicit connect

From: Parthasarathy Bhuvaragan <parthasarathy.bhuvaragan@ericsson.com>

[ Upstream commit 92ef12b32feab8f277b69e9fb89ede2796777f4d ]

In the case of implicit connect message with data > 1K, the flow
control accounting is incorrect. At this state, the socket does not
know the peer nodes capability and falls back to legacy flow control
by return 1, however the receiver of this message will perform the
new block accounting. This leads to a slack and eventually traffic
disturbance.

In this commit, we perform tipc_node_get_capabilities() at implicit
connect and perform accounting based on the peer's capability.
