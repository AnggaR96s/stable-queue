Subject: usb: dwc2: host: Fix transaction errors in host mode

From: Minas Harutyunyan <hminas@synopsys.com>

[ Upstream commit 92a8dd26464e1f21f1d869ec53717bd2c1200d63 ]

Added missing GUSBCFG programming in host mode, which fixes
transaction errors issue on HiKey and Altera Cyclone V boards.

These field even if was programmed in device mode (in function
dwc2_hsotg_core_init_disconnected()) will be resetting to POR values
after core soft reset applied.
So, each time when switching to host mode required to set this field
to correct value.
