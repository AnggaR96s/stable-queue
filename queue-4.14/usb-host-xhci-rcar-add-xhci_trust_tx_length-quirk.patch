Subject: usb: host: xhci-rcar: Add XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk

From: Yasushi Asano <yasano@jp.adit-jv.com>

commit 40fc165304f0faaae78b761f8ee30b5d216b1850 upstream.

When plugging BUFFALO LUA4-U3-AGT USB3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet LAN
Adapter, warning messages filled up dmesg.

[  101.098287] xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: WARN Successful completion on short TX for slot 1 ep 4: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?
[  101.117463] xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: WARN Successful completion on short TX for slot 1 ep 4: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?
[  101.136513] xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: WARN Successful completion on short TX for slot 1 ep 4: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?

Adding the XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk resolves the issue.
