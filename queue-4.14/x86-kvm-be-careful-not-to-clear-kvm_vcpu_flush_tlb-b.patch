Subject: x86/kvm: Be careful not to clear KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB bit

[ Upstream commit 8c6de56a42e0c657955e12b882a81ef07d1d073e ]

kvm_steal_time_set_preempted() may accidentally clear KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB
bit if it is called more than once while VCPU is preempted.

This is part of CVE-2019-3016.

(This bug was also independently discovered by Jim Mattson
<jmattson@google.com>)
