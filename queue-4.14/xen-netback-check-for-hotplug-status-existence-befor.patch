Subject: xen-netback: Check for hotplug-status existence before watching

From: Michael Brown <mbrown@fensystems.co.uk>

[ Upstream commit 2afeec08ab5c86ae21952151f726bfe184f6b23d ]

The logic in connect() is currently written with the assumption that
xenbus_watch_pathfmt() will return an error for a node that does not
exist.  This assumption is incorrect: xenstore does allow a watch to
be registered for a nonexistent node (and will send notifications
should the node be subsequently created).

As of commit 1f2565780 ("xen-netback: remove 'hotplug-status' once it
has served its purpose"), this leads to a failure when a domU
transitions into XenbusStateConnected more than once.  On the first
domU transition into Connected state, the "hotplug-status" node will
be deleted by the hotplug_status_changed() callback in dom0.  On the
second or subsequent domU transition into Connected state, the
hotplug_status_changed() callback will therefore never be invoked, and
so the backend will remain stuck in InitWait.

This failure prevents scenarios such as reloading the xen-netfront
module within a domU, or booting a domU via iPXE.  There is
unfortunately no way for the domU to work around this dom0 bug.

Fix by explicitly checking for existence of the "hotplug-status" node,
thereby creating the behaviour that was previously assumed to exist.
