Subject: dmaengine: rcar-dmac: Fix too early/late system suspend/resume callbacks

From: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>

[ Upstream commit 73dcc666d6bd0db56cd556010f93d8f04c1cc70c ]

If serial console wake-up is enabled ("echo enabled >
/sys/.../ttySC0/power/wakeup"), and any serial input is received while
the system is suspended, serial port input no longer works after system
resume.

Note that:
  1) The system can still be woken up using the serial console,
  2) Serial port input keeps working if the system is woken up in some
     other way (e.g. Wake-on-LAN or gpio-keys), and no serial input was
     received while suspended.

To fix this, replace SET_LATE_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS() by
SET_NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS(), as the callbacks installed by the
former happen too early resp. late in the suspend resp. resume process.
