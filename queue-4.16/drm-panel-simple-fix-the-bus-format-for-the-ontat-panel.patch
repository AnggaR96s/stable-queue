Subject: drm/panel: simple: Fix the bus format for the Ontat panel

From: Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>

[ Upstream commit 5651e5e094591f479adad5830ac1bc45196a39b3 ]

This fixes bad color output.  When I was first testing the device I
had the DPI hardware set to 666 mode, but apparently in the refactor
to use the bus_format information from the panel driver, I failed to
actually update the panel.
