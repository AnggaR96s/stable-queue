Subject: drm/vmwgfx: Unpin the screen object backup buffer when not used

From: Thomas Hellstrom <thellstrom@vmware.com>

[ Upstream commit 20fb5a635a0c8478ac98f15cfafc2ea83df29565 ]

We were relying on the pinned screen object backup buffer to be destroyed
when not used. But if we hold a copy of the atomic state, like when
hibernating, the backup buffer might not be destroyed since it's
refcounted by the atomic state. This causes us to hibernate with a
buffer pinned in VRAM.

Fix this by only having the buffer pinned when it is actually used by a
screen object.
