commit 395a2076b4064f97d3fce03af15210ff2a7bb7f9 upstream.

This patch is required allows access to a Microsoft fileserver failover
cluster behind a 1:1 NAT firewall.

The change also provides stronger context for authentication and share
connection (see MS-SMB2 3.3.5.7 and MS-SRVS 3.1.6.8) as noted by
Tom Talpey, and addresses comments about the buffer size for the UNC
made by Aurélien Aptel.
