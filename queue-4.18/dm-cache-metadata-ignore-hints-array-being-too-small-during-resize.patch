Subject: dm cache metadata: ignore hints array being too small during resize

From: Joe Thornber <ejt@redhat.com>

commit 4561ffca88c546f96367f94b8f1e4715a9c62314 upstream.

Commit fd2fa9541 ("dm cache metadata: save in-core policy_hint_size to
on-disk superblock") enabled previously written policy hints to be
used after a cache is reactivated.  But in doing so the cache
metadata's hint array was left exposed to out of bounds access because
on resize the metadata's on-disk hint array wasn't ever extended.

Fix this by ignoring that there are no on-disk hints associated with the
newly added cache blocks.  An expanded on-disk hint array is later
rewritten upon the next clean shutdown of the cache.
