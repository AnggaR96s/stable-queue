Subject: drm: Get ref on CRTC commit object when waiting for flip_done

From: Leo Li <sunpeng.li@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 4364bcb2cd21d042bde4776448417ddffbc54045 ]

This fixes a general protection fault, caused by accessing the contents
of a flip_done completion object that has already been freed. It occurs
due to the preemption of a non-blocking commit worker thread W by
another commit thread X. X continues to clear its atomic state at the
end, destroying the CRTC commit object that W still needs. Switching
back to W and accessing the commit objects then leads to bad results.

Worker W becomes preemptable when waiting for flip_done to complete. At
this point, a frequently occurring commit thread X can take over. Here's
an example where W is a worker thread that flips on both CRTCs, and X
does a legacy cursor update on both CRTCs:

        ...
     1. W does flip work
     2. W runs commit_hw_done()
     3. W waits for flip_done on CRTC 1
     4. > flip_done for CRTC 1 completes
     5. W finishes waiting for CRTC 1
     6. W waits for flip_done on CRTC 2

     7. > Preempted by X
     8. > flip_done for CRTC 2 completes
     9. X atomic_check: hw_done and flip_done are complete on all CRTCs
    10. X updates cursor on both CRTCs
    11. X destroys atomic state
    12. X done

    13. > Switch back to W
    14. W waits for flip_done on CRTC 2
    15. W raises general protection fault

The error looks like so:

    general protection fault: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI

Note that i915 has this issue masked, since hw_done is signaled after
waiting for flip_done. Doing so will block the cursor update from
happening until hw_done is signaled, preventing the cursor commit from
destroying the state.

v2: The reference on the commit object needs to be obtained before
    hw_done() is signaled, since that's the point where another commit
    is allowed to modify the state. Assuming that the
    new_crtc_state->commit object still exists within flip_done() is
    incorrect.

    Fix by getting a reference in setup_commit(), and releasing it
    during default_clear().
