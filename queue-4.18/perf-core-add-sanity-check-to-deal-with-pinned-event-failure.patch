Subject: perf/core: Add sanity check to deal with pinned event failure

From: Reinette Chatre <reinette.chatre@intel.com>

commit befb1b3c2703897c5b8ffb0044dc5d0e5f27c5d7 upstream.

It is possible that a failure can occur during the scheduling of a
pinned event. The initial portion of perf_event_read_local() contains
the various error checks an event should pass before it can be
considered valid. Ensure that the potential scheduling failure
of a pinned event is checked for and have a credible error.
