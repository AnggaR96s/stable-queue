Subject: RDMA/uverbs: Atomically flush and mark closed the comp event queue

From: Steve Wise <swise@opengridcomputing.com>

commit 67e3816842fe6414d629c7515b955952ec40c7d7 upstream.

Currently a uverbs completion event queue is flushed of events in
ib_uverbs_comp_event_close() with the queue spinlock held and then
released.  Yet setting ev_queue->is_closed is not set until later in
uverbs_hot_unplug_completion_event_file().

In between the time ib_uverbs_comp_event_close() releases the lock and
uverbs_hot_unplug_completion_event_file() acquires the lock, a completion
event can arrive and be inserted into the event queue by
ib_uverbs_comp_handler().

This can cause a "double add" list_add warning or crash depending on the
kernel configuration, or a memory leak because the event is never dequeued
since the queue is already closed down.

So add setting ev_queue->is_closed = 1 to ib_uverbs_comp_event_close().
