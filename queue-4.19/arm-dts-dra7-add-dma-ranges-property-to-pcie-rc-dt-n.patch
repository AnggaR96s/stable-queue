Subject: ARM: dts: dra7: Add "dma-ranges" property to PCIe RC DT nodes

From: Kishon Vijay Abraham I <kishon@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit 27f13774654ea6bd0b6fc9b97cce8d19e5735661 ]

'dma-ranges' in a PCI bridge node does correctly set dma masks for PCI
devices not described in the DT. Certain DRA7 platforms (e.g., DRA76)
has RAM above 32-bit boundary (accessible with LPAE config) though the
PCIe bridge will be able to access only 32-bits. Add 'dma-ranges'
property in PCIe RC DT nodes to indicate the host bridge can access
only 32 bits.
