Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: fix pinctrl sub nodename for spi in rk322x.dtsi

From: Johan Jonker <jbx6244@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 855bdca1781c79eb661f89c8944c4a719ce720e8 ]

A test with the command below gives these errors:

arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3229-evb.dt.yaml: spi-0:
'#address-cells' is a required property
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3229-evb.dt.yaml: spi-1:
'#address-cells' is a required property
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3229-xms6.dt.yaml: spi-0:
'#address-cells' is a required property
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3229-xms6.dt.yaml: spi-1:
'#address-cells' is a required property

The $nodename pattern for spi nodes is
"^spi(@.*|-[0-9a-f])*$". To prevent warnings rename
'spi-0' and 'spi-1' pinctrl sub nodenames to
'spi0' and 'spi1' in 'rk322x.dtsi'.
