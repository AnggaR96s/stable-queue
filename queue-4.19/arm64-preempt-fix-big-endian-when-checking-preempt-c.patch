Subject: arm64: preempt: Fix big-endian when checking preempt count in
 assembly

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 7faa313f05cad184e8b17750f0cbe5216ac6debb ]

Commit 396244692232 ("arm64: preempt: Provide our own implementation of
asm/preempt.h") extended the preempt count field in struct thread_info
to 64 bits, so that it consists of a 32-bit count plus a 32-bit flag
indicating whether or not the current task needs rescheduling.

Whilst the asm-offsets definition of TSK_TI_PREEMPT was updated to point
to this new field, the assembly usage was left untouched meaning that a
32-bit load from TSK_TI_PREEMPT on a big-endian machine actually returns
the reschedule flag instead of the count.

Whilst we could fix this by pointing TSK_TI_PREEMPT at the count field,
we're actually better off reworking the two assembly users so that they
operate on the whole 64-bit value in favour of inspecting the thread
flags separately in order to determine whether a reschedule is needed.
