Subject: bpf: Reject indirect var_off stack access in unpriv mode

commit 088ec26d9c2da9d879ab73e3f4117f9df6c566ee upstream.

Proper support of indirect stack access with variable offset in
unprivileged mode (!root) requires corresponding support in Spectre
masking for stack ALU in retrieve_ptr_limit().

There are no use-case for variable offset in unprivileged mode though so
make verifier reject such accesses for simplicity.

Pointer arithmetics is one (and only?) way to cause variable offset and
it's already rejected in unpriv mode so that verifier won't even get to
helper function whose argument contains variable offset, e.g.:

  0: (7a) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = 0
  1: (7a) *(u64 *)(r10 -8) = 0
  2: (61) r2 = *(u32 *)(r1 +0)
  3: (57) r2 &= 4
  4: (17) r2 -= 16
  5: (0f) r2 += r10
  variable stack access var_off=(0xfffffffffffffff0; 0x4) off=-16 size=1R2
  stack pointer arithmetic goes out of range, prohibited for !root

Still it looks like a good idea to reject variable offset indirect stack
access for unprivileged mode in check_stack_boundary() explicitly.

Fixes: 2011fccfb61b ("bpf: Support variable offset stack access from helpers")
