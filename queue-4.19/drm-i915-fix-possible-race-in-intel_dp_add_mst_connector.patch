commit 7c4512300cfa5a4dcc8c1c52ae61e3fa4bd11a39 upstream.

This hasn't caused any issues yet that I'm aware of, but as Ville
Syrjälä pointed out - we need to make sure that
intel_connector->mst_port is set before initializing MST connectors,
since in theory we could potentially check intel_connector->mst_port in
i915_hpd_poll_init_work() after registering the connector but before
having written it's value.
