Subject: fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore

From: Rik van Riel <riel@surriel.com>

commit 5cbcb62dddf5346077feb82b7b0c9254222d3445 upstream.

While taking a kernel core dump with makedumpfile on a larger system,
softlockup messages often appear.

While softlockup warnings can be harmless, they can also interfere with
things like RCU freeing memory, which can be problematic when the kdump
kexec image is configured with as little memory as possible.

Avoid the softlockup, and give things like work items and RCU a chance to
do their thing during __read_vmcore by adding a cond_resched.
