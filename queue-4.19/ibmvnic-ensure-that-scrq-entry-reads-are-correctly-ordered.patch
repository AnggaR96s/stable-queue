Subject: ibmvnic: Ensure that SCRQ entry reads are correctly ordered

From: Thomas Falcon <tlfalcon@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit b71ec952234610b4f90ef17a2fdcb124d5320070 ]

Ensure that received Subordinate Command-Response Queue (SCRQ)
entries are properly read in order by the driver. These queues
are used in the ibmvnic device to process RX buffer and TX completion
descriptors. dma_rmb barriers have been added after checking for a
pending descriptor to ensure the correct descriptor entry is checked
and after reading the SCRQ descriptor to ensure the entire
descriptor is read before processing.
