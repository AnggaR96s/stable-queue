Subject: Input: synaptics - add PNP ID for ThinkPad P50 to SMBus

From: Lyude Paul <lyude@redhat.com>

commit 9df39bedbf292680655c6a947c77d6562c693d4a upstream.

Noticed the other day the trackpoint felt different on my P50, then
realized it was because rmi4 wasn't loading for this machine
automatically. Suspend/resume, hibernate, and everything else seem to
work perfectly fine on here.
