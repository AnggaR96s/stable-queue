Subject: kbuild: improve cc-option to clean up all temporary files

From: Masahiro Yamada <masahiroy@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit f2f02ebd8f3833626642688b2d2c6a7b3c141fa9 ]

When cc-option and friends evaluate compiler flags, the temporary file
$$TMP is created as an output object, and automatically cleaned up.
The actual file path of $$TMP is .<pid>.tmp, here <pid> is the process
ID of $(shell ...) invoked from cc-option. (Please note $$$$ is the
escape sequence of $$).

Such garbage files are cleaned up in most cases, but some compiler flags
create additional output files.

For example, -gsplit-dwarf creates a .dwo file.

When CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT=y, you will see a bunch of .<pid>.dwo files
left in the top of build directories. You may not notice them unless you
do 'ls -a', but the garbage files will increase every time you run 'make'.

This commit changes the temporary object path to .tmp_<pid>/tmp, and
removes .tmp_<pid> directory when exiting. Separate build artifacts such
as *.dwo will be cleaned up all together because their file paths are
usually determined based on the base name of the object.

Another example is -ftest-coverage, which outputs the coverage data into
<base-name-of-object>.gcno
