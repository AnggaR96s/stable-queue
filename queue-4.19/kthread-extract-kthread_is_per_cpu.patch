Subject: kthread: Extract KTHREAD_IS_PER_CPU

From: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>

[ Upstream commit ac687e6e8c26181a33270efd1a2e2241377924b0 ]

There is a need to distinguish geniune per-cpu kthreads from kthreads
that happen to have a single CPU affinity.

Geniune per-cpu kthreads are kthreads that are CPU affine for
correctness, these will obviously have PF_KTHREAD set, but must also
have PF_NO_SETAFFINITY set, lest userspace modify their affinity and
ruins things.

However, these two things are not sufficient, PF_NO_SETAFFINITY is
also set on other tasks that have their affinities controlled through
other means, like for instance workqueues.

Therefore another bit is needed; it turns out kthread_create_per_cpu()
already has such a bit: KTHREAD_IS_PER_CPU, which is used to make
kthread_park()/kthread_unpark() work correctly.

Expose this flag and remove the implicit setting of it from
kthread_create_on_cpu(); the io_uring usage of it seems dubious at
best.
