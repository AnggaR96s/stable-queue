Subject: KVM: x86: Mark CR4.TSD as being possibly owned by the guest

From: Sean Christopherson <sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>

commit 7c83d096aed055a7763a03384f92115363448b71 upstream.

Mark CR4.TSD as being possibly owned by the guest as that is indeed the
case on VMX.  Without TSD being tagged as possibly owned by the guest, a
targeted read of CR4 to get TSD could observe a stale value.  This bug
is benign in the current code base as the sole consumer of TSD is the
emulator (for RDTSC) and the emulator always "reads" the entirety of CR4
when grabbing bits.

Add a build-time assertion in to ensure VMX doesn't hand over more CR4
bits without also updating x86.

Fixes: 52ce3c21aec3 ("x86,kvm,vmx: Don't trap writes to CR4.TSD")
