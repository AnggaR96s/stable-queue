Subject: mm/vmstat.c: fix NUMA statistics updates

From: Janne Huttunen <janne.huttunen@nokia.com>

[ Upstream commit 13c9aaf7fa01cc7600c61981609feadeef3354ec ]

Scan through the whole array to see if an update is needed.  While we're
at it, use sizeof() to be safe against any possible type changes in the
future.

The bug here is that we wouldn't sync per-cpu counters into global ones
if there was an update of numa_stats for higher cpus.  Highly
theoretical one though because it is much more probable that zone_stats
are updated so we would refresh anyway.  So I wouldn't bother to mark
this for stable, yet something nice to fix.
