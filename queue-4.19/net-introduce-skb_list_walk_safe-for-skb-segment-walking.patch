Subject: net: introduce skb_list_walk_safe for skb segment walking

From: Jason A. Donenfeld <Jason@zx2c4.com>

commit dcfea72e79b0aa7a057c8f6024169d86a1bbc84b upstream.

As part of the continual effort to remove direct usage of skb->next and
skb->prev, this patch adds a helper for iterating through the
singly-linked variant of skb lists, which are used for lists of GSO
packet. The name "skb_list_..." has been chosen to match the existing
function, "kfree_skb_list, which also operates on these singly-linked
lists, and the "..._walk_safe" part is the same idiom as elsewhere in
the kernel.

This patch removes the helper from wireguard and puts it into
linux/skbuff.h, while making it a bit more robust for general usage. In
particular, parenthesis are added around the macro argument usage, and it
now accounts for trying to iterate through an already-null skb pointer,
which will simply run the iteration zero times. This latter enhancement
means it can be used to replace both do { ... } while and while (...)
open-coded idioms.

This should take care of these three possible usages, which match all
current methods of iterations.

skb_list_walk_safe(segs, skb, next) { ... }
skb_list_walk_safe(skb, skb, next) { ... }
skb_list_walk_safe(segs, skb, segs) { ... }

Gcc appears to generate efficient code for each of these.
