Subject: nvmem: qfprom: remove incorrect write support

From: Srinivas Kandagatla <srinivas.kandagatla@linaro.org>

commit 8d9eb0d6d59a5d7028c80a30831143d3e75515a7 upstream.

qfprom has different address spaces for read and write. Reads are
always done from corrected address space, where as writes are done
on raw address space.
Writing to corrected address space is invalid and ignored, so it
does not make sense to have this support in the driver which only
supports corrected address space regions at the moment.

Fixes: 4ab11996b489 ("nvmem: qfprom: Add Qualcomm QFPROM support.")
