Subject: power: supply: rt5033_battery: Fix device tree enumeration

From: Stephan Gerhold <stephan@gerhold.net>

[ Upstream commit f3076cd8d1d5fa64b5e1fa5affc045c2fc123baa ]

The fuel gauge in the RT5033 PMIC has its own I2C bus and interrupt
line. Therefore, it is not actually part of the RT5033 MFD and needs
its own of_match_table to probe properly.

Also, given that it's independent of the MFD, there is actually
no need to make the Kconfig depend on MFD_RT5033. Although the driver
uses the shared <linux/mfd/rt5033.h> header, there is no compile
or runtime dependency on the RT5033 MFD driver.
