Subject: powerpc/pseries/mobility: prevent cpu hotplug during DT update

[ Upstream commit e59a175faa8df9d674247946f2a5a9c29c835725 ]

CPU online/offline code paths are sensitive to parts of the device
tree (various cpu node properties, cache nodes) that can be changed as
a result of a migration.

Prevent CPU hotplug while the device tree potentially is inconsistent.

Fixes: 410bccf97881 ("powerpc/pseries: Partition migration in the kernel")
