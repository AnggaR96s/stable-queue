Subject: pstore/ram: Run without kernel crash dump region

From: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>

commit 8880fa32c557600f5f624084152668ed3c2ea51e upstream.

The ram pstore backend has always had the crash dumper frontend enabled
unconditionally. However, it was possible to effectively disable it
by setting a record_size=0. All the machinery would run (storing dumps
to the temporary crash buffer), but 0 bytes would ultimately get stored
due to there being no przs allocated for dumps. Commit 89d328f637b9
("pstore/ram: Correctly calculate usable PRZ bytes"), however, assumed
that there would always be at least one allocated dprz for calculating
the size of the temporary crash buffer. This was, of course, not the
case when record_size=0, and would lead to a NULL deref trying to find
the dprz buffer size:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at (null)
...
IP: ramoops_probe+0x285/0x37e (fs/pstore/ram.c:808)

        cxt->pstore.bufsize = cxt->dprzs[0]->buffer_size;

Instead, we need to only enable the frontends based on the success of the
prz initialization and only take the needed actions when those zones are
available. (This also fixes a possible error in detecting if the ftrace
frontend should be enabled.)
