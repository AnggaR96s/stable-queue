[ Upstream commit 33da8e7c814f77310250bb54a9db36a44c5de784 ]

My recent to change to only use force_sig for a synchronous events
wound up breaking signal reception cifs and drbd.  I had overlooked
the fact that by default kthreads start out with all signals set to
SIG_IGN.  So a change I thought was safe turned out to have made it
impossible for those kernel thread to catch their signals.

Reverting the work on force_sig is a bad idea because what the code
was doing was very much a misuse of force_sig.  As the way force_sig
ultimately allowed the signal to happen was to change the signal
handler to SIG_DFL.  Which after the first signal will allow userspace
to send signals to these kernel threads.  At least for
wake_ack_receiver in drbd that does not appear actively wrong.

So correct this problem by adding allow_kernel_signal that will allow
signals whose siginfo reports they were sent by the kernel through,
but will not allow userspace generated signals, and update cifs and
drbd to call allow_kernel_signal in an appropriate place so that their
thread can receive this signal.

Fixing things this way ensures that userspace won't be able to send
signals and cause problems, that it is clear which signals the
threads are expecting to receive, and it guarantees that nothing
else in the system will be affected.

This change was partly inspired by similar cifs and drbd patches that
added allow_signal.
