Subject: soc: renesas: r8a77980-sysc: Correct names of A2DP[01] power domains

From: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>

[ Upstream commit 97473bc85b22ac610b1810b6a9a4669a6cb0b7b0 ]

The R-Car Gen3 HardWare Manual Errata for Rev. 0.80 (Feb 28, 2018)
renamed the A2PD0 and A2DP0 power domains on R-Car V3H to A2DP0 resp.
A2DP1.

As these definitions are not yet used from DT, they can just be renamed.

Fixes: 7755b40d07a8dba7 ("dt-bindings: power: add R8A77980 SYSC power domain definitions")
Fixes: 41d6d8bd8ae94ca9 ("soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: add R8A77980 support")
