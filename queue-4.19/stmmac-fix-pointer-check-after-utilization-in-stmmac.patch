Subject: stmmac: fix pointer check after utilization in stmmac_interrupt

From: Maxim Petrov <mmrmaximuzz@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit f42234ffd531ca6b13d9da02faa60b72eccf8334 ]

The paranoidal pointer check in IRQ handler looks very strange - it
really protects us only against bogus drivers which request IRQ line
with null pointer dev_id. However, the code fragment is incorrect
because the dev pointer is used before the actual check which leads
to undefined behavior. Remove the check to avoid confusing people
with incorrect code.
