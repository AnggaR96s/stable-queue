Subject: wlcore: sdio: Fixup power on/off sequence

[ Upstream commit 13e62626c578d9889ebbda7c521be5adff9bef8e ]

During "wlan-up", we are programming the FW into the WiFi-chip. However,
re-programming the FW doesn't work, unless a power cycle of the WiFi-chip
is made in-between the programmings.

To conform to this requirement and to fix the regression in a simple way,
let's start by allowing that the SDIO card (WiFi-chip) may stay powered on
(runtime resumed) when wl12xx_sdio_power_off() returns. The intent with the
current code is to treat this scenario as an error, but unfortunate this
doesn't work as expected, so let's fix this.

The other part is to guarantee that a power cycle of the SDIO card has been
completed when wl12xx_sdio_power_on() returns, as to allow the FW
programming to succeed. However, relying solely on runtime PM to deal with
this isn't sufficient. For example, userspace may prevent runtime suspend
via sysfs for the device that represents the SDIO card, leading to that the
mmc core also keeps it powered on. For this reason, let's instead do a
brute force power cycle in wl12xx_sdio_power_on().
