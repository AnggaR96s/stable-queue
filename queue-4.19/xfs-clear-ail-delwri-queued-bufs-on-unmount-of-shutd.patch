Subject: xfs: clear ail delwri queued bufs on unmount of shutdown fs

From: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit efc3289cf8d39c34502a7cc9695ca2fa125aad0c ]

In the typical unmount case, the AIL is forced out by the unmount
sequence before the xfsaild task is stopped. Since AIL items are
removed on writeback completion, this means that the AIL
->ail_buf_list delwri queue has been drained. This is not always
true in the shutdown case, however.

It's possible for buffers to sit on a delwri queue for a period of
time across submission attempts if said items are locked or have
been relogged and pinned since first added to the queue. If the
attempt to log such an item results in a log I/O error, the error
processing can shutdown the fs, remove the item from the AIL, stale
the buffer (dropping the LRU reference) and clear its delwri queue
state. The latter bit means the buffer will be released from a
delwri queue on the next submission attempt, but this might never
occur if the filesystem has shutdown and the AIL is empty.

This means that such buffers are held indefinitely by the AIL delwri
queue across destruction of the AIL. Aside from being a memory leak,
these buffers can also hold references to in-core perag structures.
The latter problem manifests as a generic/475 failure, reproducing
the following asserts at unmount time:

  XFS: Assertion failed: atomic_read(&pag->pag_ref) == 0,
	file: fs/xfs/xfs_mount.c, line: 151
  XFS: Assertion failed: atomic_read(&pag->pag_ref) == 0,
	file: fs/xfs/xfs_mount.c, line: 132

To prevent this problem, clear the AIL delwri queue as a final step
before xfsaild() exit. The !empty state should never occur in the
normal case, so add an assert to catch unexpected problems going
forward.

[dgc: add comment explaining need for xfs_buf_delwri_cancel() after
 calling xfs_buf_delwri_submit_nowait().]
