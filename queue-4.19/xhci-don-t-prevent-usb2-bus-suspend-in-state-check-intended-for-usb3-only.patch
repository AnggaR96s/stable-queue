Subject: xhci: Don't prevent USB2 bus suspend in state check intended for USB3 only

From: Mathias Nyman <mathias.nyman@linux.intel.com>

commit 45f750c16cae3625014c14c77bd9005eda975d35 upstream.

The code to prevent a bus suspend if a USB3 port was still in link training
also reacted to USB2 port polling state.
This caused bus suspend to busyloop in some cases.
USB2 polling state is different from USB3, and should not prevent bus
suspend.

Limit the USB3 link training state check to USB3 root hub ports only.
The origial commit went to stable so this need to be applied there as well
