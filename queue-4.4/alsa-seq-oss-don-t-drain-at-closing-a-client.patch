Subject: ALSA: seq: oss: Don't drain at closing a client

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 197b958c1e76a575d77038cc98b4bebc2134279f upstream.

The OSS sequencer client tries to drain the pending events at
releasing.  Unfortunately, as spotted by syzkaller fuzzer, this may
lead to an unkillable process state when the event has been queued at
the far future.  Since the process being released can't be signaled
any longer, it remains and waits for the echo-back event in that far
future.

Back to history, the draining feature was implemented at the time we
misinterpreted POSIX definition for blocking file operation.
Actually, such a behavior is superfluous at release, and we should
just release the device as is instead of keeping it up forever.

This patch just removes the draining call that may block the release
for too long time unexpectedly.
