Subject: arm64: Define AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH for ARCH_DLINFO

From: James Hogan <james.hogan@imgtec.com>

commit 3146bc64d12377a74dbda12b96ea32da3774ae07 upstream.

AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH should be defined with the maximum number of
NEW_AUX_ENT entries that ARCH_DLINFO can contain, but it wasn't defined
for arm64 at all even though ARCH_DLINFO will contain one NEW_AUX_ENT
for the VDSO address.

This shouldn't be a problem as AT_VECTOR_SIZE_BASE includes space for
AT_BASE_PLATFORM which arm64 doesn't use, but lets define it now and add
the comment above ARCH_DLINFO as found in several other architectures to
remind future modifiers of ARCH_DLINFO to keep AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH up to
date.
