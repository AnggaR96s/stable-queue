Subject: block: make sure a big bio is split into at most 256 bvecs

From: Ming Lei <ming.lei@canonical.com>

commit 4d70dca4eadf2f95abe389116ac02b8439c2d16c upstream.

After arbitrary bio size was introduced, the incoming bio may
be very big. We have to split the bio into small bios so that
each holds at most BIO_MAX_PAGES bvecs for safety reason, such
as bio_clone().

This patch fixes the following kernel crash:

The issue can be reproduced by the following steps:
	- create one raid1 over two virtio-blk
	- build bcache device over the above raid1 and another cache device
	and bucket size is set as 2Mbytes
	- set cache mode as writeback
	- run random write over ext4 on the bcache device
