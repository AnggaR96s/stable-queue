Subject: bnx2x: Fix Multi-Cos

From: "Mintz, Yuval" <Yuval.Mintz@cavium.com>


[ Upstream commit 3968d38917eb9bd0cd391265f6c9c538d9b33ffa ]

Apparently multi-cos isn't working for bnx2x quite some time -
driver implements ndo_select_queue() to allow queue-selection
for FCoE, but the regular L2 flow would cause it to modulo the
fallback's result by the number of queues.
The fallback would return a queue matching the needed tc
[via __skb_tx_hash()], but since the modulo is by the number of TSS
queues where number of TCs is not accounted, transmission would always
be done by a queue configured into using TC0.

Fixes: ada7c19e6d27 ("bnx2x: use XPS if possible for bnx2x_select_queue instead of pure hash")
