Subject: bonding: Fix ARP monitor validation

From: Jay Vosburgh <jay.vosburgh@canonical.com>

[ Upstream commit 21a75f0915dde8674708b39abfcda113911c49b1 ]

The current logic in bond_arp_rcv will accept an incoming ARP for
validation if (a) the receiving slave is either "active" (which includes
the currently active slave, or the current ARP slave) or, (b) there is a
currently active slave, and it has received an ARP since it became active.
For case (b), the receiving slave isn't the currently active slave, and is
receiving the original broadcast ARP request, not an ARP reply from the
target.

	This logic can fail if there is no currently active slave.  In
this situation, the ARP probe logic cycles through all slaves, assigning
each in turn as the "current_arp_slave" for one arp_interval, then setting
that one as "active," and sending an ARP probe from that slave.  The
current logic expects the ARP reply to arrive on the sending
current_arp_slave, however, due to switch FDB updating delays, the reply
may be directed to another slave.

	This can arise if the bonding slaves and switch are working, but
the ARP target is not responding.  When the ARP target recovers, a
condition may result wherein the ARP target host replies faster than the
switch can update its forwarding table, causing each ARP reply to be sent
to the previous current_arp_slave.  This will never pass the logic in
bond_arp_rcv, as neither of the above conditions (a) or (b) are met.

	Some experimentation on a LAN shows ARP reply round trips in the
200 usec range, but my available switches never update their FDB in less
than 4000 usec.

	This patch changes the logic in bond_arp_rcv to additionally
accept an ARP reply for validation on any slave if there is a current ARP
slave and it sent an ARP probe during the previous arp_interval.
