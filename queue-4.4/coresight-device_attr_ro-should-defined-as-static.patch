Subject: coresight: "DEVICE_ATTR_RO" should defined as static.

[ Upstream commit bf16e5b8cdeabc1fe6565af0be475bb2084dc388 ]

"DEVICE_ATTR_RO(name)" should be defined as static. And
there is an unnecessary space at the front of the code.

The sparse tool output logs as the following:
coresight-etm4x.c:2224:1: warning: symbol 'dev_attr_trcoslsr' was
not declared. Should it be static?
coresight-etm4x.c:2225:1: warning: symbol 'dev_attr_trcpdcr' was
not declared. Should it be static?
coresight-etm4x.c:2226:1: warning: symbol 'dev_attr_trcpdsr' was
not declared. Should it be static?
And the smatch tool output logs as the following:
of_coresight.c:89 of_coresight_alloc_memory() warn:
inconsistent indenting
