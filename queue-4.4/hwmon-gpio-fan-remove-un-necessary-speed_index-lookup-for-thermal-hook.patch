Subject: hwmon: (gpio-fan) Remove un-necessary speed_index lookup for thermal hook

From: Nishanth Menon <nm@ti.com>

commit 000e0949148382c4962489593a2f05504c2a6771 upstream.

Thermal hook gpio_fan_get_cur_state is only interested in knowing
the current speed index that was setup in the system, this is
already available as part of fan_data->speed_index which is always
set by set_fan_speed. Using get_fan_speed_index is useful when we
have no idea about the fan speed configuration (for example during
fan_ctrl_init).

When thermal framework invokes
gpio_fan_get_cur_state=>get_fan_speed_index via gpio_fan_get_cur_state
especially in a polled configuration for thermal governor, we
basically hog the i2c interface to the extent that other functions
fail to get any traffic out :(.

Instead, just provide the last state set in the driver - since the gpio
fan driver is responsible for the fan state immaterial of override, the
fan_data->speed_index should accurately reflect the state.
