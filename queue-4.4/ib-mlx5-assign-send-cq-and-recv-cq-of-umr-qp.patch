Subject: IB/mlx5: Assign send CQ and recv CQ of UMR QP

From: Majd Dibbiny <majd@mellanox.com>


[ Upstream commit 31fde034a8bd964a5c7c1a5663fc87a913158db2 ]

The UMR's QP is created by calling mlx5_ib_create_qp directly, and
therefore the send CQ and the recv CQ on the ibqp weren't assigned.

Assign them right after calling the mlx5_ib_create_qp to assure
that any access to those pointers will work as expected and won't
crash the system as might happen as part of reset flow.

Fixes: e126ba97dba9 ("mlx5: Add driver for Mellanox Connect-IB adapters")
