Subject: iommu/vt-d: Flush old iommu caches for kdump when the device gets context mapped

From: Xunlei Pang <xlpang@redhat.com>

commit aec0e86172a79eb5e44aff1055bb953fe4d47c59 upstream.

We met the DMAR fault both on hpsa P420i and P421 SmartArray controllers
under kdump, it can be steadily reproduced on several different machines,
the dmesg log is like:
HP HPSA Driver (v 3.4.16-0)
hpsa 0000:02:00.0: using doorbell to reset controller
hpsa 0000:02:00.0: board ready after hard reset.

DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
DMAR: [DMA Read] Request device [02:00.0] fault addr fffff000 [fault reason 06] PTE Read access is not set
hpsa 0000:02:00.0: controller message 03:00 timed out
hpsa 0000:02:00.0: no-op failed; re-trying

After some debugging, we found that the fault addr is from DMA initiated at
the driver probe stage after reset(not in-flight DMA), and the corresponding
pte entry value is correct, the fault is likely due to the old iommu caches
of the in-flight DMA before it.

Thus we need to flush the old cache after context mapping is setup for the
device, where the device is supposed to finish reset at its driver probe
stage and no in-flight DMA exists hereafter.

I'm not sure if the hardware is responsible for invalidating all the related
caches allocated in the iommu hardware before, but seems not the case for hpsa,
actually many device drivers have problems in properly resetting the hardware.
Anyway flushing (again) by software in kdump kernel when the device gets context
mapped which is a quite infrequent operation does little harm.

With this patch, the problematic machine can survive the kdump tests.
