Subject: irda: do not leak initialized list.dev to userspace

From: Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>


[ Upstream commit b024d949a3c24255a7ef1a470420eb478949aa4c ]

list.dev has not been initialized and so the copy_to_user is copying
data from the stack back to user space which is a potential
information leak. Fix this ensuring all of list is initialized to
zero.
