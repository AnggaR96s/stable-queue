Subject: MIPS: math-emu: Prevent wrong ISA mode instruction emulation

From: Maciej W. Rozycki <macro@imgtec.com>

commit 13769ebad0c42738831787e27c7c7f982e7da579 upstream.

Terminate FPU emulation immediately whenever an ISA mode switch has been
observed.  This is so that we do not interpret machine code in the wrong
mode, for example when a regular MIPS FPU instruction has been placed in
a delay slot of a jump that switches into the MIPS16 mode, as with the
following code (taken from a GCC test suite case):

00400650 <set_fast_math>:
  400650:	3c020100 	lui	v0,0x100
  400654:	03e00008 	jr	ra

  40131a:	e8a0      	jrc	ra

Here `set_fast_math' is called from `40130e' (`40130f' with the ISA bit)
and emulation triggers for the CTC1 instruction.  As it is in a jump
delay slot emulation continues from `401312' (`401313' with the ISA
bit).  However we have no path to handle MIPS16 FPU code emulation,
because there are no MIPS16 FPU instructions.  So the default emulation
path is taken, interpreting a 32-bit word fetched by `get_user' from
`401313' as a regular MIPS instruction, which is:

  401313:	f5ea0a92	sdc1	$f10,2706(t7)

This makes the FPU emulator proceed with the supposed SDC1 instruction
and consequently makes the program considered here terminate with
SIGSEGV.

A similar although less severe issue exists with pure-microMIPS
processors in the case where similarly an FPU instruction is emulated in
a delay slot of a register jump that (incorrectly) switches into the
regular MIPS mode.  A subsequent instruction fetch from the jump's
target is supposed to cause an Address Error exception, however instead
we proceed with regular MIPS FPU emulation.

For simplicity then, always terminate the emulation loop whenever a mode
change is detected, denoted by an ISA mode bit flip.  As from commit
377cb1b6c16a ("MIPS: Disable MIPS16/microMIPS crap for platforms not
supporting these ASEs.") the result of `get_isa16_mode' can be hardcoded
to 0, so we need to examine the ISA mode bit by hand.

This complements commit 102cedc32a6e ("MIPS: microMIPS: Floating point
support.") which added JALX decoding to FPU emulation.
