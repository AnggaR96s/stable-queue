Subject: mm: check VMA flags to avoid invalid PROT_NONE NUMA balancing

From: Lorenzo Stoakes <lstoakes@gmail.com>

commit 38e088546522e1e86d2b8f401a1354ad3a9b3303 upstream.

The NUMA balancing logic uses an arch-specific PROT_NONE page table flag
defined by pte_protnone() or pmd_protnone() to mark PTEs or huge page
PMDs respectively as requiring balancing upon a subsequent page fault.
User-defined PROT_NONE memory regions which also have this flag set will
not normally invoke the NUMA balancing code as do_page_fault() will send
a segfault to the process before handle_mm_fault() is even called.

However if access_remote_vm() is invoked to access a PROT_NONE region of
memory, handle_mm_fault() is called via faultin_page() and
__get_user_pages() without any access checks being performed, meaning
the NUMA balancing logic is incorrectly invoked on a non-NUMA memory
region.

A simple means of triggering this problem is to access PROT_NONE mmap'd
memory using /proc/self/mem which reliably results in the NUMA handling
functions being invoked when CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING is set.

This issue was reported in bugzilla (issue 99101) which includes some
simple repro code.

There are BUG_ON() checks in do_numa_page() and do_huge_pmd_numa_page()
added at commit c0e7cad to avoid accidentally provoking strange
behaviour by attempting to apply NUMA balancing to pages that are in
fact PROT_NONE.  The BUG_ON()'s are consistently triggered by the repro.

This patch moves the PROT_NONE check into mm/memory.c rather than
invoking BUG_ON() as faulting in these pages via faultin_page() is a
valid reason for reaching the NUMA check with the PROT_NONE page table
flag set and is therefore not always a bug.
