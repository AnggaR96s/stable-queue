Subject: mm/hwpoison: fix wrong num_poisoned_pages accounting

From: Minchan Kim <minchan@kernel.org>

commit d7e69488bd04de165667f6bc741c1c0ec6042ab9 upstream.

Currently, migration code increses num_poisoned_pages on *failed*
migration page as well as successfully migrated one at the trial of
memory-failure.  It will make the stat wrong.  As well, it marks the
page as PG_HWPoison even if the migration trial failed.  It would mean
we cannot recover the corrupted page using memory-failure facility.

This patches fixes it.
