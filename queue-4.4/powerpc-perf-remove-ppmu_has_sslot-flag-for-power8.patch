Subject: powerpc/perf: Remove PPMU_HAS_SSLOT flag for Power8

From: Madhavan Srinivasan <maddy@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit 370f06c88528b3988fe24a372c10e1303bb94cf6 upstream.

Commit 7a7868326d77 ("powerpc/perf: Add an explict flag indicating
presence of SLOT field") introduced the PPMU_HAS_SSLOT flag to remove
the assumption that MMCRA[SLOT] was present when PPMU_ALT_SIPR was not
set.

That commit's changelog also mentions that Power8 does not support
MMCRA[SLOT]. However when the Power8 PMU support was merged, it
errnoeously included the PPMU_HAS_SSLOT flag.

So remove PPMU_HAS_SSLOT from the Power8 flags.

mpe: On systems where MMCRA[SLOT] exists, the field occupies bits 37:39
(IBM numbering). On Power8 bit 37 is reserved, and 38:39 overlap with
the high bits of the Threshold Event Counter Mantissa. I am not aware of
any published events which use the threshold counting mechanism, which
would cause the mantissa bits to be set. So in practice this bug is
unlikely to trigger.
