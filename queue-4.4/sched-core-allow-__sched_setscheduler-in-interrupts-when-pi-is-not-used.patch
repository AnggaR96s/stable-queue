Subject: sched/core: Allow __sched_setscheduler() in interrupts when PI is not used

From: Steven Rostedt (VMware) <rostedt@goodmis.org>

commit 896bbb2522587e3b8eb2a0d204d43ccc1042a00d upstream.

When priority inheritance was added back in 2.6.18 to sched_setscheduler(), it
added a path to taking an rt-mutex wait_lock, which is not IRQ safe. As PI
is not a common occurrence, lockdep will likely never trigger if
sched_setscheduler was called from interrupt context. A BUG_ON() was added
to trigger if __sched_setscheduler() was ever called from interrupt context
because there was a possibility to take the wait_lock.

Today the wait_lock is irq safe, but the path to taking it in
sched_setscheduler() is the same as the path to taking it from normal
context. The wait_lock is taken with raw_spin_lock_irq() and released with
raw_spin_unlock_irq() which will indiscriminately enable interrupts,
which would be bad in interrupt context.

The problem is that normalize_rt_tasks, which is called by triggering the
sysrq nice-all-RT-tasks was changed to call __sched_setscheduler(), and this
is done from interrupt context!

Now __sched_setscheduler() takes a "pi" parameter that is used to know if
the priority inheritance should be called or not. As the BUG_ON() only cares
about calling the PI code, it should only bug if called from interrupt
context with the "pi" parameter set to true.
