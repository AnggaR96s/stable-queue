Subject: sched/cputime: Fix steal_account_process_tick() to always return jiffies

From: Chris Friesen <cbf123@mail.usask.ca>

commit f9c904b7613b8b4c85b10cd6b33ad41b2843fa9d upstream.

The callers of steal_account_process_tick() expect it to return
whether a jiffy should be considered stolen or not.

Currently the return value of steal_account_process_tick() is in
units of cputime, which vary between either jiffies or nsecs
depending on CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN.

If cputime has nsecs granularity and there is a tiny amount of
stolen time (a few nsecs, say) then we will consider the entire
tick stolen and will not account the tick on user/system/idle,
causing /proc/stats to show invalid data.

The fix is to change steal_account_process_tick() to accumulate
the stolen time and only account it once it's worth a jiffy.

(Thanks to Frederic Weisbecker for suggestions to fix a bug in my
first version of the patch.)
