Subject: sctp: Fix port hash table size computation

From: Neil Horman <nhorman@tuxdriver.com>

[ Upstream commit d9749fb5942f51555dc9ce1ac0dbb1806960a975 ]

Dmitry Vyukov noted recently that the sctp_port_hashtable had an error in
its size computation, observing that the current method never guaranteed
that the hashsize (measured in number of entries) would be a power of two,
which the input hash function for that table requires.  The root cause of
the problem is that two values need to be computed (one, the allocation
order of the storage requries, as passed to __get_free_pages, and two the
number of entries for the hash table).  Both need to be ^2, but for
different reasons, and the existing code is simply computing one order
value, and using it as the basis for both, which is wrong (i.e. it assumes
that ((1<<order)*PAGE_SIZE)/sizeof(bucket) is still ^2 when its not).

To fix this, we change the logic slightly.  We start by computing a goal
allocation order (which is limited by the maximum size hash table we want
to support.  Then we attempt to allocate that size table, decreasing the
order until a successful allocation is made.  Then, with the resultant
successful order we compute the number of buckets that hash table supports,
which we then round down to the nearest power of two, giving us the number
of entries the table actually supports.

I've tested this locally here, using non-debug and spinlock-debug kernels,
and the number of entries in the hashtable consistently work out to be
powers of two in all cases.
