Subject: selftest: timers: Tweak raw_skew to SKIP when ADJ_OFFSET/other clock adjustments are in progress

From: John Stultz <john.stultz@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 1416270f4a1ae83ea84156ceba19a66a8f88be1f ]

In the past we've warned when ADJ_OFFSET was in progress, usually
caused by ntpd or some other time adjusting daemon running in non
steady sate, which can cause the skew calculations to be
incorrect.

Thus, this patch checks to see if the clock was being adjusted
when we fail so that we don't cause false negatives.
