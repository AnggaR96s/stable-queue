Subject: selftests: do not require bash for the generated test

From: Rolf Eike Beer <eb@emlix.com>

commit a2b1e8a20c992b01eeb76de00d4f534cbe9f3822 upstream.

Nothing in this minimal script seems to require bash. We often run these
tests on embedded devices where the only shell available is the busybox
ash. Use sh instead.
