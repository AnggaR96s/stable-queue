[ Upstream commit 5e844cc37a5cbaa460e68f9a989d321d63088a89 ]

SPI driver probing currently comprises two steps, whereas removal
comprises only one step:

    spi_alloc_master()
    spi_register_master()

    spi_unregister_master()

That's because spi_unregister_master() calls device_unregister()
instead of device_del(), thereby releasing the reference on the
spi_master which was obtained by spi_alloc_master().

An SPI driver's private data is contained in the same memory allocation
as the spi_master struct.  Thus, once spi_unregister_master() has been
called, the private data is inaccessible.  But some drivers need to
access it after spi_unregister_master() to perform further teardown
steps.

Introduce devm_spi_alloc_master(), which releases a reference on the
spi_master struct only after the driver has unbound, thereby keeping the
memory allocation accessible.  Change spi_unregister_master() to not
release a reference if the spi_master was allocated by the new devm
function.

The present commit is small enough to be backportable to stable.
It allows fixing drivers which use the private data in their ->remove()
hook after it's been freed.  It also allows fixing drivers which neglect
to release a reference on the spi_master in the probe error path.

Long-term, most SPI drivers shall be moved over to the devm function
introduced herein.  The few that can't shall be changed in a treewide
commit to explicitly release the last reference on the master.
That commit shall amend spi_unregister_master() to no longer release
a reference, thereby completing the migration.

As a result, the behaviour will be less surprising and more consistent
with subsystems such as IIO, which also includes the private data in the
allocation of the generic iio_dev struct, but calls device_del() in
iio_device_unregister().
