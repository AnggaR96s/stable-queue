Subject: staging: sm750fb: avoid conflicting vesafb

From: Teddy Wang <teddy.wang@siliconmotion.com>

commit 740c433ec35187b45abe08bb6c45a321a791be8e upstream.

If vesafb is enabled in the config then /dev/fb0 is created by vesa
and this sm750 driver gets fb1, fb2. But we need to be fb0 and fb1 to
effectively work with xorg.
So if it has been alloted fb1, then try to remove the other fb0.

In the previous send, why #ifdef is used was asked.

Also pasting here for reference.

'Did a quick research into "why".
The patch d8801e4df91e ("x86/PCI: Set IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW only for the
default VGA device") has started setting IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW in flags
for a default VGA device and that is being done only for x86.
And so, we will need that #ifdef to check IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW as that
needs to be checked only for a x86 and not for other arch.'
