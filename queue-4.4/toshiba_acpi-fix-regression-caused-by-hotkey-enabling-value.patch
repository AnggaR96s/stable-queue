Subject: toshiba_acpi: Fix regression caused by hotkey enabling value

From: Azael Avalos <coproscefalo@gmail.com>

commit a30b8f81d9d6fe24eab8a023794548b048f08e3c upstream.

Commit 52cbae0127ad ("toshiba_acpi: Change default Hotkey enabling value")
changed the hotkeys enabling value, as it was the same value Windows uses,
however, it turns out that the value tells the EC that the driver will now
take care of the hardware events like the physical RFKill switch or the
pointing device toggle button.

This patch reverts such commit by changing the default hotkey enabling
value to 0x09, which enables hotkey events only, making the hardware
buttons working again.

Fixes bugs 113331 and 114941.
