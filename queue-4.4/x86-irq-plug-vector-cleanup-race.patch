Subject: x86/irq: Plug vector cleanup race

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit 98229aa36caa9c769b13565523de9b813013c703 upstream.

We still can end up with a stale vector due to the following:

CPU0                          CPU1                      CPU2
lock_vector()
data->move_in_progress=0
sendIPI()
unlock_vector()
                              set_affinity()
                              assign_irq_vector()
                              lock_vector()             handle_IPI
                              move_in_progress = 1      lock_vector()
                              unlock_vector()
                                                        move_in_progress == 1

So we need to serialize the vector assignment against a pending cleanup. The
solution is rather simple now. We not only check for the move_in_progress flag
in assign_irq_vector(), we also check whether there is still a cleanup pending
in the old_domain cpumask. If so, we return -EBUSY to the caller and let him
deal with it. Though we have to be careful in the cpu unplug case. If the
cleanout has not yet completed then the following setaffinity() call would
return -EBUSY. Add code which prevents this.
