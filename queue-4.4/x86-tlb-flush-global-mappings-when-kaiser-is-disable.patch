Subject: x86/tlb: Flush global mappings when KAISER is disabled

From: Borislav Petkov <bp@suse.de>

Jim Mattson reported that Debian 9 guests using a 4.9-stable kernel
are exploding during alternatives patching:

  kernel BUG at /build/linux-dqnRSc/linux-4.9.228/arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:709!
  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP
  Modules linked in:
  CPU: 1 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.9.0-13-amd64 #1 Debian 4.9.228-1
  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 01/01/2011
  Call Trace:
   swap_entry_free
   swap_entry_free

   do_one_initcall
   set_debug_rodata
   kernel_init_freeable
   rest_init
   kernel_init
   ret_from_fork

triggering the BUG_ON in text_poke() which verifies whether patched
instruction bytes have actually landed at the destination.

Further debugging showed that the TLB flush before that check is
insufficient because there could be global mappings left in the TLB,
leading to a stale mapping getting used.

I say "global mappings" because the hardware configuration is a new one:
machine is an AMD, which means, KAISER/PTI doesn't need to be enabled
there, which also means there's no user/kernel pagetables split and
therefore the TLB can have global mappings.

And the configuration is new one for a second reason: because that AMD
machine supports PCID and INVPCID, which leads the CPU detection code to
set the synthetic X86_FEATURE_INVPCID_SINGLE flag.

Now, __native_flush_tlb_single() does invalidate global mappings when
X86_FEATURE_INVPCID_SINGLE is *not* set and returns.

When X86_FEATURE_INVPCID_SINGLE is set, however, it invalidates the
requested address from both PCIDs in the KAISER-enabled case. But if
KAISER is not enabled and the machine has global mappings in the TLB,
then those global mappings do not get invalidated, which would lead to
the above mismatch from using a stale TLB entry.

So make sure to flush those global mappings in the KAISER disabled case.
