Subject: xhci: Do warm-reset when both CAS and XDEV_RESUME are set

From: Kai-Heng Feng <kai.heng.feng@canonical.com>

commit 904df64a5f4d5ebd670801d869ca0a6d6a6e8df6 upstream.

Sometimes re-plugging a USB device during system sleep renders the device
useless:
[  173.418345] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Get port status 2-4 read: 0x14203e2, return 0x10262
...
[  176.496485] usb 2-4: Waited 2000ms for CONNECT
[  176.496781] usb usb2-port4: status 0000.0262 after resume, -19
[  176.497103] usb 2-4: can't resume, status -19
[  176.497438] usb usb2-port4: logical disconnect

Because PLS equals to XDEV_RESUME, xHCI driver reports U3 to usbcore,
despite of CAS bit is flagged.

So proritize CAS over XDEV_RESUME to let usbcore handle warm-reset for
the port.
