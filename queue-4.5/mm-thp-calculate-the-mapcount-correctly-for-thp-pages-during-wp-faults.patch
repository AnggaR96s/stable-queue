Subject: mm: thp: calculate the mapcount correctly for THP pages during WP faults

From: Andrea Arcangeli <aarcange@redhat.com>

commit 6d0a07edd17cfc12fdc1f36de8072fa17cc3666f upstream.

This will provide fully accuracy to the mapcount calculation in the
write protect faults, so page pinning will not get broken by false
positive copy-on-writes.

total_mapcount() isn't the right calculation needed in
reuse_swap_page(), so this introduces a page_trans_huge_mapcount()
that is effectively the full accurate return value for page_mapcount()
if dealing with Transparent Hugepages, however we only use the
page_trans_huge_mapcount() during COW faults where it strictly needed,
due to its higher runtime cost.

This also provide at practical zero cost the total_mapcount
information which is needed to know if we can still relocate the page
anon_vma to the local vma. If page_trans_huge_mapcount() returns 1 we
can reuse the page no matter if it's a pte or a pmd_trans_huge
triggering the fault, but we can only relocate the page anon_vma to
the local vma->anon_vma if we're sure it's only this "vma" mapping the
whole THP physical range.

Kirill A. Shutemov discovered the problem with moving the page
anon_vma to the local vma->anon_vma in a previous version of this
patch and another problem in the way page_move_anon_rmap() was called.

Andrew Morton discovered that CONFIG_SWAP=n wouldn't build in a
previous version, because reuse_swap_page must be a macro to call
page_trans_huge_mapcount from swap.h, so this uses a macro again
instead of an inline function. With this change at least it's a less
dangerous usage than it was before, because "page" is used only once
now, while with the previous code reuse_swap_page(page++) would have
called page_mapcount on page+1 and it would have increased page twice
instead of just once.

Dean Luick noticed an uninitialized variable that could result in a
rmap inefficiency for the non-THP case in a previous version.

Mike Marciniszyn said:

: Our RDMA tests are seeing an issue with memory locking that bisects to
: commit 61f5d698cc97 ("mm: re-enable THP")
:
: The test program registers two rather large MRs (512M) and RDMA
: writes data to a passive peer using the first and RDMA reads it back
: into the second MR and compares that data.  The sizes are chosen randomly
: between 0 and 1024 bytes.
:
: The test will get through a few (<= 4 iterations) and then gets a
: compare error.
:
: Tracing indicates the kernel logical addresses associated with the individual
: pages at registration ARE correct , the data in the "RDMA read response only"
: packets ARE correct.
:
: The "corruption" occurs when the packet crosse two pages that are not physically
: contiguous.   The second page reads back as zero in the program.
:
: It looks like the user VA at the point of the compare error no longer points to
: the same physical address as was registered.
:
: This patch totally resolves the issue!
