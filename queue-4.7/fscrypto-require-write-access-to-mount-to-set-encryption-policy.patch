Subject: fscrypto: require write access to mount to set encryption policy

From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

commit ba63f23d69a3a10e7e527a02702023da68ef8a6d upstream.

Since setting an encryption policy requires writing metadata to the
filesystem, it should be guarded by mnt_want_write/mnt_drop_write.
Otherwise, a user could cause a write to a frozen or readonly
filesystem.  This was handled correctly by f2fs but not by ext4.  Make
fscrypt_process_policy() handle it rather than relying on the filesystem
to get it right.
