Subject: sched/fair: Fix min_vruntime tracking

From: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>

commit b60205c7c558330e4e2b5df498355ec959457358 upstream.

While going through enqueue/dequeue to review the movement of
set_curr_task() I noticed that the (2nd) update_min_vruntime() call in
dequeue_entity() is suspect.

It turns out, its actually wrong because it will consider
cfs_rq->curr, which could be the entry we just normalized. This mixes
different vruntime forms and leads to fail.

The purpose of the second update_min_vruntime() is to move
min_vruntime forward if the entity we just removed is the one that was
holding it back; _except_ for the DEQUEUE_SAVE case, because then we
know its a temporary removal and it will come back.

However, since we do put_prev_task() _after_ dequeue(), cfs_rq->curr
will still be set (and per the above, can be tranformed into a
different unit), so update_min_vruntime() should also consider
curr->on_rq. This also fixes another corner case where the enqueue
(which also does update_curr()->update_min_vruntime()) happens on the
rq->lock break in schedule(), between dequeue and put_prev_task.
