Subject: ARM: dts: armada-38x: Fix assigned-addresses for every PCIe Root Port
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

From: Pali Rohár <pali@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 44f47b7a8fa4678ce4c38ea74837e4996b9df6d6 ]

BDF of resource in DT assigned-addresses property of Marvell PCIe Root Port
(PCI-to-PCI bridge) should match BDF in address part in that DT node name
as specified resource belongs to Marvell PCIe Root Port itself.
