Subject: batman-adv: mcast: fix duplicate mcast packets in BLA backbone from LAN
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Cc: b.a.t.m.a.n@lists.open-mesh.org, "Linus Lüssing" <linus.luessing@c0d3.blue>, "Simon Wunderlich" <sw@simonwunderlich.de>, "Sven Eckelmann" <sven@narfation.org>
Message-ID: <20211120123958.260826-4-sven@narfation.org>

From: Linus Lüssing <linus.luessing@c0d3.blue>

commit 3236d215ad38a3f5372e65cd1e0a52cf93d3c6a2 upstream.

Scenario:
* Multicast frame send from a BLA backbone (multiple nodes with
  their bat0 bridged together, with BLA enabled)

Issue:
* BLA backbone nodes receive the frame multiple times on bat0

For multicast frames received via batman-adv broadcast packets the
originator of the broadcast packet is checked before decapsulating and
forwarding the frame to bat0 (batadv_bla_is_backbone_gw()->
batadv_recv_bcast_packet()). If it came from a node which shares the
same BLA backbone with us then it is not forwarded to bat0 to avoid a
loop.

When sending a multicast frame in a non-4-address batman-adv unicast
packet we are currently missing this check - and cannot do so because
the batman-adv unicast packet has no originator address field.

However, we can simply fix this on the sender side by only sending the
multicast frame via unicasts to interested nodes which do not share the
same BLA backbone with us. This also nicely avoids some unnecessary
transmissions on mesh side.

Note that no infinite loop was observed, probably because of dropping
via batadv_interface_tx()->batadv_bla_tx(). However the duplicates still
utterly confuse switches/bridges, ICMPv6 duplicate address detection and
neighbor discovery and therefore leads to long delays before being able
to establish TCP connections, for instance. And it also leads to the Linux
bridge printing messages like:
"br-lan: received packet on eth1 with own address as source address ..."
