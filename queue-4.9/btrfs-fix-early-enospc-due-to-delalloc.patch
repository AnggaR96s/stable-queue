Subject: Btrfs: fix early ENOSPC due to delalloc

From: Omar Sandoval <osandov@fb.com>

commit 17024ad0a0fdfcfe53043afb969b813d3e020c21 upstream.

If a lot of metadata is reserved for outstanding delayed allocations, we
rely on shrink_delalloc() to reclaim metadata space in order to fulfill
reservation tickets. However, shrink_delalloc() has a shortcut where if
it determines that space can be overcommitted, it will stop early. This
made sense before the ticketed enospc system, but now it means that
shrink_delalloc() will often not reclaim enough space to fulfill any
tickets, leading to an early ENOSPC. (Reservation tickets don't care
about being able to overcommit, they need every byte accounted for.)

Fix it by getting rid of the shortcut so that shrink_delalloc() reclaims
all of the metadata it is supposed to. This fixes early ENOSPCs we were
seeing when doing a btrfs receive to populate a new filesystem, as well
as early ENOSPCs Christoph saw when doing a big cp -r onto Btrfs.
