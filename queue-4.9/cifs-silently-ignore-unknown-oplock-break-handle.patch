Subject: cifs: Silently ignore unknown oplock break handle

From: Vincent Whitchurch <vincent.whitchurch@axis.com>

[ Upstream commit 219481a8f90ec3a5eed9638fb35609e4b1aeece7 ]

Make SMB2 not print out an error when an oplock break is received for an
unknown handle, similar to SMB1.  The debug message which is printed for
these unknown handles may also be misleading, so fix that too.

The SMB2 lease break path is not affected by this patch.

Without this, a program which writes to a file from one thread, and
opens, reads, and writes the same file from another thread triggers the
below errors several times a minute when run against a Samba server
configured with "smb2 leases = no".

 CIFS: VFS: \\192.168.0.1 No task to wake, unknown frame received! NumMids 2
