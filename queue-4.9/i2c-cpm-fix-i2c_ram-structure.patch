Subject: i2c: cpm: Fix i2c_ram structure

From: Nicolas VINCENT <nicolas.vincent@vossloh.com>

[ Upstream commit a2bd970aa62f2f7f80fd0d212b1d4ccea5df4aed ]

the i2c_ram structure is missing the sdmatmp field mentionned in
datasheet for MPC8272 at paragraph 36.5. With this field missing, the
hardware would write past the allocated memory done through
cpm_muram_alloc for the i2c_ram structure and land in memory allocated
for the buffers descriptors corrupting the cbd_bufaddr field. Since this
field is only set during setup(), the first i2c transaction would work
and the following would send data read from an arbitrary memory
location.
