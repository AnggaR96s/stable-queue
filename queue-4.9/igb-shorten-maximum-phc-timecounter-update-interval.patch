Subject: igb: shorten maximum PHC timecounter update interval

From: Miroslav Lichvar <mlichvar@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 094bf4d0e9657f6ea1ee3d7e07ce3970796949ce ]

The timecounter needs to be updated at least once per ~550 seconds in
order to avoid a 40-bit SYSTIM timestamp to be misinterpreted as an old
timestamp.

Since commit 500462a9d ("timers: Switch to a non-cascading wheel"),
scheduling of delayed work seems to be less accurate and a requested
delay of 540 seconds may actually be longer than 550 seconds. Shorten
the delay to 480 seconds to be sure the timecounter is updated in time.

This fixes an issue with HW timestamps on 82580/I350/I354 being off by
~1100 seconds for few seconds every ~9 minutes.
