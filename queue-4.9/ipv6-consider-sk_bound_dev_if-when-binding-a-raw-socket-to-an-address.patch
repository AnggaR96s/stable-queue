Subject: ipv6: Consider sk_bound_dev_if when binding a raw socket to an address

From: Mike Manning <mmanning@vyatta.att-mail.com>

[ Upstream commit 72f7cfab6f93a8ea825fab8ccfb016d064269f7f ]

IPv6 does not consider if the socket is bound to a device when binding
to an address. The result is that a socket can be bound to eth0 and
then bound to the address of eth1. If the device is a VRF, the result
is that a socket can only be bound to an address in the default VRF.

Resolve by considering the device if sk_bound_dev_if is set.
