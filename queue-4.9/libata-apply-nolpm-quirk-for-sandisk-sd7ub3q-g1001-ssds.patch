Subject: libata: Apply NOLPM quirk for SanDisk SD7UB3Q*G1001 SSDs

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

commit 184add2ca23ce5edcac0ab9c3b9be13f91e7b567 upstream.

Richard Jones has reported that using med_power_with_dipm on a T450s
with a Sandisk SD7UB3Q256G1001 SSD (firmware version X2180501) is
causing the machine to hang.

Switching the LPM to max_performance fixes this, so it seems that
this Sandisk SSD does not handle LPM well.

Note in the past there have been bug-reports about the following
Sandisk models not working with min_power, so we may need to extend
the quirk list in the future: name - firmware
Sandisk SD6SB2M512G1022I   - X210400
Sandisk SD6PP4M-256G-1006  - A200906
