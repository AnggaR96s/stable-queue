Subject: locking/xchg/alpha: Add unconditional memory barrier to cmpxchg()

From: Andrea Parri <parri.andrea@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit cb13b424e986aed68d74cbaec3449ea23c50e167 ]

Continuing along with the fight against smp_read_barrier_depends() [1]
(or rather, against its improper use), add an unconditional barrier to
cmpxchg.  This guarantees that dependency ordering is preserved when a
dependency is headed by an unsuccessful cmpxchg.  As it turns out, the
change could enable further simplification of LKMM as proposed in [2].
