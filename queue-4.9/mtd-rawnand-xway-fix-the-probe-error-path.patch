Subject: mtd: rawnand: xway: Fix the probe error path

From: Miquel Raynal <miquel.raynal@bootlin.com>

[ Upstream commit 34531be5e804a8e1abf314a6c3a19fe342e4a154 ]

nand_release() is supposed be called after MTD device registration.
Here, only nand_scan() happened, so use nand_cleanup() instead.

There is no real Fixes tag applying here as the use of nand_release()
in this driver predates the introduction of nand_cleanup() in
commit d44154f969a4 ("mtd: nand: Provide nand_cleanup() function to free NAND related resources")
which makes this change possible. However, pointing this commit as the
culprit for backporting purposes makes sense even if this commit is not
introducing any bug.
