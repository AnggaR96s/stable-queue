Subject: net/mlx4_core: Avoid delays during VF driver device shutdown

From: Jack Morgenstein <jackm@dev.mellanox.co.il>


[ Upstream commit 4cbe4dac82e423ecc9a0ba46af24a860853259f4 ]

Some Hypervisors detach VFs from VMs by instantly causing an FLR event
to be generated for a VF.

In the mlx4 case, this will cause that VF's comm channel to be disabled
before the VM has an opportunity to invoke the VF device's "shutdown"
method.

For such Hypervisors, there is a race condition between the VF's
shutdown method and its internal-error detection/reset thread.

The internal-error detection/reset thread (which runs every 5 seconds) also
detects a disabled comm channel. If the internal-error detection/reset
flow wins the race, we still get delays (while that flow tries repeatedly
to detect comm-channel recovery).

The cited commit fixed the command timeout problem when the
internal-error detection/reset flow loses the race.

This commit avoids the unneeded delays when the internal-error
detection/reset flow wins.

Fixes: d585df1c5ccf ("net/mlx4_core: Avoid command timeouts during VF driver device shutdown")
