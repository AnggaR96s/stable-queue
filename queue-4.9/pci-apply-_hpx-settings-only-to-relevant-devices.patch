Subject: PCI: Apply _HPX settings only to relevant devices

From: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com>


[ Upstream commit 977509f7c5c6fb992ffcdf4291051af343b91645 ]

Previously we didn't check the type of device before trying to apply Type 1
(PCI-X) or Type 2 (PCIe) Setting Records from _HPX.

We don't support PCI-X Setting Records, so this was harmless, but the
warning was useless.

We do support PCIe Setting Records, and we didn't check whether a device
was PCIe before applying settings.  I don't think anything bad happened on
non-PCIe devices because pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word(),
pcie_cap_has_lnkctl(), etc., would fail before doing any harm.  But it's
ugly to depend on those internals.

Check the device type before attempting to apply Type 1 and Type 2 Setting
Records (Type 0 records are applicable to PCI, PCI-X, and PCIe devices).

A side benefit is that this prevents useless "not supported" warnings when
a BIOS supplies a Type 1 (PCI-X) Setting Record and we try to apply it to
every single device:

  pci 0000:00:00.0: PCI-X settings not supported

After this patch, we'll get the warning only when a BIOS supplies a Type 1
record and we have a PCI-X device to which it should be applied.
