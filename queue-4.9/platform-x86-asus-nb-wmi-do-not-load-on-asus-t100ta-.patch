Subject: platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: Do not load on Asus T100TA and T200TA

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 3bd12da7f50b8bc191fcb3bab1f55c582234df59 ]

asus-nb-wmi does not add any extra functionality on these Asus
Transformer books. They have detachable keyboards, so the hotkeys are
send through a HID device (and handled by the hid-asus driver) and also
the rfkill functionality is not used on these devices.

Besides not adding any extra functionality, initializing the WMI interface
on these devices actually has a negative side-effect. For some reason
the \_SB.ATKD.INIT() function which asus_wmi_platform_init() calls drives
GPO2 (INT33FC:02) pin 8, which is connected to the front facing webcam LED,
high and there is no (WMI or other) interface to drive this low again
causing the LED to be permanently on, even during suspend.

This commit adds a blacklist of DMI system_ids on which not to load the
asus-nb-wmi and adds these Transformer books to this list. This fixes
the webcam LED being permanently on under Linux.
