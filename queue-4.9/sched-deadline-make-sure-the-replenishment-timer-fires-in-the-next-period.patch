Subject: sched/deadline: Make sure the replenishment timer fires in the next period

From: Daniel Bristot de Oliveira <bristot@redhat.com>


[ Upstream commit 5ac69d37784b237707a7b15d199cdb6c6fdb6780 ]

Currently, the replenishment timer is set to fire at the deadline
of a task. Although that works for implicit deadline tasks because the
deadline is equals to the begin of the next period, that is not correct
for constrained deadline tasks (deadline < period).

For instance:

f.c:
 --------------- %< ---------------
int main (void)
{
	for(;;);
}
 --------------- >% ---------------

  # gcc -o f f.c

  # trace-cmd record -e sched:sched_switch                              \
				   -e syscalls:sys_exit_sched_setattr   \
   chrt -d --sched-runtime  490000000					\
           --sched-deadline 500000000					\
	   --sched-period  1000000000 0 ./f

  # trace-cmd report | grep "{pid of ./f}"

After setting parameters, the task is replenished and continue running
until being throttled:

         f-11295 [003] 13322.113776: sys_exit_sched_setattr: 0x0

The task is throttled after running 492318 ms, as expected:

         f-11295 [003] 13322.606094: sched_switch:   f:11295 [-1] R ==> watchdog/3:32 [0]

But then, the task is replenished 500719 ms after the first
replenishment:

    <idle>-0     [003] 13322.614495: sched_switch:   swapper/3:0 [120] R ==> f:11295 [-1]

Running for 490277 ms:

         f-11295 [003] 13323.104772: sched_switch:   f:11295 [-1] R ==>  swapper/3:0 [120]

Hence, in the first period, the task runs 2 * runtime, and that is a bug.

During the first replenishment, the next deadline is set one period away.
So the runtime / period starts to be respected. However, as the second
replenishment took place in the wrong instant, the next replenishment
will also be held in a wrong instant of time. Rather than occurring in
the nth period away from the first activation, it is taking place
in the (nth period - relative deadline).
