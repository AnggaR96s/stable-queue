Subject: sched/deadline: Throttle a constrained deadline task activated after the deadline

From: Daniel Bristot de Oliveira <bristot@redhat.com>


[ Upstream commit df8eac8cafce7d086be3bd5cf5a838fa37594dfb ]

During the activation, CBS checks if it can reuse the current task's
runtime and period. If the deadline of the task is in the past, CBS
cannot use the runtime, and so it replenishes the task. This rule
works fine for implicit deadline tasks (deadline == period), and the
CBS was designed for implicit deadline tasks. However, a task with
constrained deadline (deadine < period) might be awakened after the
deadline, but before the next period. In this case, replenishing the
task would allow it to run for runtime / deadline. As in this case
deadline < period, CBS enables a task to run for more than the
runtime / period. In a very loaded system, this can cause a domino
effect, making other tasks miss their deadlines.

To avoid this problem, in the activation of a constrained deadline
task after the deadline but before the next period, throttle the
task and set the replenishing timer to the begin of the next period,
unless it is boosted.

Reproducer:

 --------------- %< ---------------
  int main (int argc, char **argv)
  {
	int ret;
	int flags = 0;
	unsigned long l = 0;
	struct timespec ts;
	struct sched_attr attr;

	memset(&attr, 0, sizeof(attr));
	attr.size = sizeof(attr);

	attr.sched_policy   = SCHED_DEADLINE;
	attr.sched_runtime  = 2 * 1000 * 1000;		/* 2 ms */
	attr.sched_deadline = 2 * 1000 * 1000;		/* 2 ms */
	attr.sched_period   = 2 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000;	/* 2 s */

	ts.tv_sec = 0;
	ts.tv_nsec = 2000 * 1000;			/* 2 ms */

	ret = sched_setattr(0, &attr, flags);

	if (ret < 0) {
		perror("sched_setattr");
		exit(-1);
	}

	for(;;) {
		/* XXX: you may need to adjust the loop */
		for (l = 0; l < 150000; l++);
		/*
		 * The ideia is to go to sleep right before the deadline
		 * and then wake up before the next period to receive
		 * a new replenishment.
		 */
		nanosleep(&ts, NULL);
	}

	exit(0);
  }
  --------------- >% ---------------

On my box, this reproducer uses almost 50% of the CPU time, which is
obviously wrong for a task with 2/2000 reservation.
