Subject: sched/deadline: Use the revised wakeup rule for suspending constrained dl tasks

From: Daniel Bristot de Oliveira <bristot@redhat.com>

commit 3effcb4247e74a51f5d8b775a1ee4abf87cc089a upstream.

We have been facing some problems with self-suspending constrained
deadline tasks. The main reason is that the original CBS was not
designed for such sort of tasks.

One problem reported by Xunlei Pang takes place when a task
suspends, and then is awakened before the deadline, but so close
to the deadline that its remaining runtime can cause the task
to have an absolute density higher than allowed. In such situation,
the original CBS assumes that the task is facing an early activation,
and so it replenishes the task and set another deadline, one deadline
in the future. This rule works fine for implicit deadline tasks.
Moreover, it allows the system to adapt the period of a task in which
the external event source suffered from a clock drift.

However, this opens the window for bandwidth leakage for constrained
deadline tasks. For instance, a task with the following parameters:

  runtime   = 5 ms
  deadline  = 7 ms
  [density] = 5 / 7 = 0.71
  period    = 1000 ms

If the task runs for 1 ms, and then suspends for another 1ms,
it will be awakened with the following parameters:

  remaining runtime = 4
  laxity = 5

presenting a absolute density of 4 / 5 = 0.80.

In this case, the original CBS would assume the task had an early
wakeup. Then, CBS will reset the runtime, and the absolute deadline will
be postponed by one relative deadline, allowing the task to run.

The problem is that, if the task runs this pattern forever, it will keep
receiving bandwidth, being able to run 1ms every 2ms. Following this
behavior, the task would be able to run 500 ms in 1 sec. Thus running
more than the 5 ms / 1 sec the admission control allowed it to run.

Trying to address the self-suspending case, Luca Abeni, Giuseppe
Lipari, and Juri Lelli [1] revisited the CBS in order to deal with
self-suspending tasks. In the new approach, rather than
replenishing/postponing the absolute deadline, the revised wakeup rule
adjusts the remaining runtime, reducing it to fit into the allowed
density.

A revised version of the idea is:

At a given time t, the maximum absolute density of a task cannot be
higher than its relative density, that is:

  runtime / (deadline - t) <= dl_runtime / dl_deadline

Knowing the laxity of a task (deadline - t), it is possible to move
it to the other side of the equality, thus enabling to define max
remaining runtime a task can use within the absolute deadline, without
over-running the allowed density:

  runtime = (dl_runtime / dl_deadline) * (deadline - t)

For instance, in our previous example, the task could still run:

  runtime = ( 5 / 7 ) * 5
  runtime = 3.57 ms

Without causing damage for other deadline tasks. It is note worthy
that the laxity cannot be negative because that would cause a negative
runtime. Thus, this patch depends on the patch:

  df8eac8cafce ("sched/deadline: Throttle a constrained deadline task activated after the deadline")

Which throttles a constrained deadline task activated after the
deadline.

Finally, it is also possible to use the revised wakeup rule for
all other tasks, but that would require some more discussions
about pros and cons.
