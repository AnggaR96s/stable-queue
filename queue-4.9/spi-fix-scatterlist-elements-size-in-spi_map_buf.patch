Subject: spi: Fix scatterlist elements size in spi_map_buf

From: Maxime Chevallier <maxime.chevallier@bootlin.com>

commit ce99319a182fe766be67f96338386f3ec73e321c upstream.

When SPI transfers can be offloaded using DMA, the SPI core need to
build a scatterlist to make sure that the buffer to be transferred is
dma-able.

This patch fixes the scatterlist entry size computation in the case
where the maximum acceptable scatterlist entry supported by the DMA
controller is less than PAGE_SIZE, when the buffer is vmalloced.

For each entry, the actual size is given by the minimum between the
desc_len (which is the max buffer size supported by the DMA controller)
and the remaining buffer length until we cross a page boundary.

Fixes: 65598c13fd66 ("spi: Fix per-page mapping of unaligned vmalloc-ed buffer")
