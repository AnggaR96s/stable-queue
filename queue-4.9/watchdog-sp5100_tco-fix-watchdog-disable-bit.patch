Subject: watchdog: sp5100_tco: Fix watchdog disable bit

From: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>

[ Upstream commit f541c09ebfc61697b586b38c9ebaf4b70defb278 ]

According to all published information, the watchdog disable bit for SB800
compatible controllers is bit 1 of PM register 0x48, not bit 2. For the
most part that doesn't matter in practice, since the bit has to be cleared
to enable watchdog address decoding, which is the default setting, but it
still needs to be fixed.
