Subject: x86/mm: Rework lazy TLB to track the actual loaded mm

From: Andy Lutomirski <luto@kernel.org>

commit 3d28ebceaffab40f30afa87e33331560148d7b8b upstream.

Lazy TLB state is currently managed in a rather baroque manner.
AFAICT, there are three possible states:

 - Non-lazy.  This means that we're running a user thread or a
   kernel thread that has called use_mm().  current->mm ==
   current->active_mm == cpu_tlbstate.active_mm and
   cpu_tlbstate.state == TLBSTATE_OK.

 - Lazy with user mm.  We're running a kernel thread without an mm
   and we're borrowing an mm_struct.  We have current->mm == NULL,
   current->active_mm == cpu_tlbstate.active_mm, cpu_tlbstate.state
   != TLBSTATE_OK (i.e. TLBSTATE_LAZY or 0).  The current cpu is set
   in mm_cpumask(current->active_mm).  CR3 points to
   current->active_mm->pgd.  The TLB is up to date.

 - Lazy with init_mm.  This happens when we call leave_mm().  We
   have current->mm == NULL, current->active_mm ==
   cpu_tlbstate.active_mm, but that mm is only relelvant insofar as
   the scheduler is tracking it for refcounting.  cpu_tlbstate.state
   != TLBSTATE_OK.  The current cpu is clear in
   mm_cpumask(current->active_mm).  CR3 points to swapper_pg_dir,
   i.e. init_mm->pgd.

This patch simplifies the situation.  Other than perf, x86 stops
caring about current->active_mm at all.  We have
cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm pointing to the mm that CR3 references.  The
TLB is always up to date for that mm.  leave_mm() just switches us
to init_mm.  There are no longer any special cases for mm_cpumask,
and switch_mm() switches mms without worrying about laziness.

After this patch, cpu_tlbstate.state serves only to tell the TLB
flush code whether it may switch to init_mm instead of doing a
normal flush.

This makes fairly extensive changes to xen_exit_mmap(), which used
to look a bit like black magic.

Perf is unchanged.  With or without this change, perf may behave a bit
erratically if it tries to read user memory in kernel thread context.
We should build on this patch to teach perf to never look at user
memory when cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm != current->mm.
