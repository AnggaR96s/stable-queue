Subject: seccomp: Make NEW_LISTENER and TSYNC flags exclusive

From: Tycho Andersen <tycho@tycho.ws>

commit 7a0df7fbc14505e2e2be19ed08654a09e1ed5bf6 upstream.

As the comment notes, the return codes for TSYNC and NEW_LISTENER
conflict, because they both return positive values, one in the case of
success and one in the case of error. So, let's disallow both of these
flags together.

While this is technically a userspace break, all the users I know
of are still waiting on me to land this feature in libseccomp, so I
think it'll be safe. Also, at present my use case doesn't require
TSYNC at all, so this isn't a big deal to disallow. If someone
wanted to support this, a path forward would be to add a new flag like
TSYNC_AND_LISTENER_YES_I_UNDERSTAND_THAT_TSYNC_WILL_JUST_RETURN_EAGAIN,
but the use cases are so different I don't see it really happening.

Finally, it's worth noting that this does actually fix a UAF issue: at the
end of seccomp_set_mode_filter(), we have:

        if (flags & SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_NEW_LISTENER) {
                if (ret < 0) {
                        listener_f->private_data = NULL;
                        fput(listener_f);
                        put_unused_fd(listener);
                } else {
                        fd_install(listener, listener_f);
                        ret = listener;
                }
        }
out_free:
        seccomp_filter_free(prepared);

But if ret > 0 because TSYNC raced, we'll install the listener fd and then
free the filter out from underneath it, causing a UAF when the task closes
it or dies. This patch also switches the condition to be simply if (ret),
so that if someone does add the flag mentioned above, they won't have to
remember to fix this too.
