Subject: serial: 8250_of: assume reg-shift of 2 for mrvl,mmp-uart

From: Lubomir Rintel <lkundrak@v3.sk>

commit f4817843e39ce78aace0195a57d4e8500a65a898 upstream.

There are two other drivers that bind to mrvl,mmp-uart and both of them
assume register shift of 2 bits. There are device trees that lack the
property and rely on that assumption.

If this driver wins the race to bind to those devices, it should behave
the same as the older deprecated driver.
