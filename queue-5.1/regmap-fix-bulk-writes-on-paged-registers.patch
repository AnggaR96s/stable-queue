Subject: regmap: fix bulk writes on paged registers

[ Upstream commit db057679de3e9e6a03c1bcd5aee09b0d25fd9f5b ]

On buses like SlimBus and SoundWire which does not support
gather_writes yet in regmap, A bulk write on paged register
would be silently ignored after programming page.
This is because local variable 'ret' value in regmap_raw_write_impl()
gets reset to 0 once page register is written successfully and the
code below checks for 'ret' value to be -ENOTSUPP before linearising
the write buffer to send to bus->write().

Fix this by resetting the 'ret' value to -ENOTSUPP in cases where
gather_writes() is not supported or single register write is
not possible.
