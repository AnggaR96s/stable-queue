Subject: ALSA: usb-audio: Register card again for iface over delayed_register
 option

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 2027f114686e0f3f1f39971964dfc618637c88c2 ]

When the delayed registration is specified via either delayed_register
option or the quirk, we delay the invocation of snd_card_register()
until the given interface.  But if a wrong value has been set there
and there are more interfaces over the given interface number,
snd_card_register() call would be missing for those interfaces.

This patch catches up those missing calls by fixing the comparison of
the interface number.  Now the call is skipped only if the processed
interface is less than the given interface, instead of the exact
match.

Fixes: b70038ef4fea ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add delayed_register option")
