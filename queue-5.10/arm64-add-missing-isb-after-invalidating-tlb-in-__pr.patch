Subject: arm64: Add missing ISB after invalidating TLB in __primary_switch

From: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 9d41053e8dc115c92b8002c3db5f545d7602498b ]

Although there has been a bit of back and forth on the subject, it
appears that invalidating TLBs requires an ISB instruction when FEAT_ETS
is not implemented by the CPU.

From the bible:

  | In an implementation that does not implement FEAT_ETS, a TLB
  | maintenance instruction executed by a PE, PEx, can complete at any
  | time after it is issued, but is only guaranteed to be finished for a
  | PE, PEx, after the execution of DSB by the PEx followed by a Context
  | synchronization event

Add the missing ISB in __primary_switch, just in case.
