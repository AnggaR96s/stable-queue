Subject: ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Increase maximum register in regmap

From: Annaliese McDermond <nh6z@nh6z.net>

commit 29654ed8384e9dbaf4cfba689dbcb664a6ab4bb7 upstream.

AIC32X4_REFPOWERUP was added as a register, but the maximum register value
in the regmap and regmap range was not correspondingly increased.  This
caused an error when this register was attempted to be written.

Fixes: ec96690de82c ("ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Enable fast charge")
