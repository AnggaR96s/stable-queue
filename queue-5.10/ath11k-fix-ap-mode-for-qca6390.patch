Subject: ath11k: fix AP mode for QCA6390

From: Kalle Valo <kvalo@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit 77d7e87128d4dfb400df4208b2812160e999c165 ]

Commit c134d1f8c436 ("ath11k: Handle errors if peer creation fails") completely
broke AP mode on QCA6390:

kernel: [  151.230734] ath11k_pci 0000:06:00.0: failed to create peer after vdev start delay: -22
wpa_supplicant[2307]: Failed to set beacon parameters
wpa_supplicant[2307]: Interface initialization failed
wpa_supplicant[2307]: wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->DISABLED
wpa_supplicant[2307]: wlan0: AP-DISABLED
wpa_supplicant[2307]: wlan0: Unable to setup interface.
wpa_supplicant[2307]: Failed to initialize AP interface

This was because commit c134d1f8c436 ("ath11k: Handle errors if peer creation
fails") added error handling for ath11k_peer_create(), which had been failing
all along but was unnoticed due to the missing error handling. The actual bug
was introduced already in commit aa44b2f3ecd4 ("ath11k: start vdev if a bss peer is
already created").

ath11k_peer_create() was failing because for AP mode the peer is created
already earlier op_add_interface() and we should skip creation here, but the
check for modes was wrong.  Fixing that makes AP mode work again.

This shouldn't affect IPQ8074 nor QCN9074 as they have hw_params.vdev_start_delay disabled.

Tested-on: QCA6390 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HST.1.0.1-01740-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1
