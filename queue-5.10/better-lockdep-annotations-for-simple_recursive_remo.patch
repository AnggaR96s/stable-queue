Subject: better lockdep annotations for simple_recursive_removal()

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

[ Upstream commit 2a8061ee5e41034eb14170ec4517b5583dbeff9f ]

We want a class that nests outside of I_MUTEX_NORMAL (for the sake of
callbacks that might want to lock the victim) and inside I_MUTEX_PARENT
(so that a variant of that could be used with parent of the victim
held locked by the caller).

In reality, simple_recursive_removal()
	* never holds two locks at once
	* holds the lock on parent of dentry passed to callback
	* is used only on the trees with fixed topology, so the depths
are not changing.

So the locking order is actually fine.

AFAICS, the best solution is to assign I_MUTEX_CHILD to the locks
grabbed by that thing.
