Subject: btrfs: use btrfs_record_snapshot_destroy() during rmdir

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

[ Upstream commit 157501b0469969fc1ba53add5049575aadd79d80 ]

We are setting the parent directory's last_unlink_trans directly which
may result in a concurrent task starting to log the directory not see the
update and therefore can log the directory after we removed a child
directory which had a snapshot within instead of falling back to a
transaction commit. Replaying such a log tree would result in a mount
failure since we can't currently delete snapshots (and subvolumes) during
log replay. This is the type of failure described in commit 1ec9a1ae1e30
("Btrfs: fix unreplayable log after snapshot delete + parent dir fsync").

Fix this by using btrfs_record_snapshot_destroy() which updates the
last_unlink_trans field while holding the inode's log_mutex lock.

Fixes: 44f714dae50a ("Btrfs: improve performance on fsync against new inode after rename/unlink")
