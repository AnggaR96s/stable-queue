Subject: dma/pool: distinguish between missing and exhausted atomic pools

From: Sai Sree Kartheek Adivi <s-adivi@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit 56c430c7f06d838fe3b2077dbbc4cc0bf992312b ]

Currently, dma_alloc_from_pool() unconditionally warns and dumps a stack
trace when an allocation fails, with the message "Failed to get suitable
pool".

This conflates two distinct failure modes:
1. Configuration error: No atomic pool is available for the requested
   DMA mask (a fundamental system setup issue)
2. Resource Exhaustion: A suitable pool exists but is currently full (a
   recoverable runtime state)

This lack of distinction prevents drivers from using __GFP_NOWARN to
suppress error messages during temporary pressure spikes, such as when
awaiting synchronous reclaim of descriptors.

Refactor the error handling to distinguish these cases:
- If no suitable pool is found, keep the unconditional WARN regarding
  the missing pool.
- If a pool was found but is exhausted, respect __GFP_NOWARN and update
  the warning message to explicitly state "DMA pool exhausted".
