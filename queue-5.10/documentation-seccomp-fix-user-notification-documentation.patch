Subject: Documentation: seccomp: Fix user notification documentation

From: Sargun Dhillon <sargun@sargun.me>

commit aac902925ea646e461c95edc98a8a57eb0def917 upstream.

The documentation had some previously incorrect information about how
userspace notifications (and responses) were handled due to a change
from a previously proposed patchset.
