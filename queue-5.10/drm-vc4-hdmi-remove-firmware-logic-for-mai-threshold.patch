Subject: drm/vc4: hdmi: Remove firmware logic for MAI threshold setting

From: Dom Cobley <popcornmix@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 8434111ccfec8fc0549ec325a632067232d38e14 ]

This was a workaround for bugs in hardware on earlier Pi models
and wasn't totally successful.

It makes audio quality worse on a Pi4 at the higher sample rates
