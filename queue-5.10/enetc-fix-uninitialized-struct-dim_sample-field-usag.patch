Subject: enetc: Fix uninitialized struct dim_sample field usage

From: Claudiu Manoil <claudiu.manoil@nxp.com>

[ Upstream commit 9f7afa05c9522b086327929ae622facab0f0f72b ]

The only struct dim_sample member that does not get
initialized by dim_update_sample() is comp_ctr. (There
is special API to initialize comp_ctr:
dim_update_sample_with_comps(), and it is currently used
only for RDMA.) comp_ctr is used to compute curr_stats->cmps
and curr_stats->cpe_ratio (see dim_calc_stats()) which in
turn are consumed by the rdma_dim_*() API.  Therefore,
functionally, the net_dim*() API consumers are not affected.
Nevertheless, fix the computation of statistics based
on an uninitialized variable, even if the mentioned statistics
are not used at the moment.
