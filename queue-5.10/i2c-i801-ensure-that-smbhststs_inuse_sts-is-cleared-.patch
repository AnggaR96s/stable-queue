Subject: i2c: i801: Ensure that SMBHSTSTS_INUSE_STS is cleared when leaving
 i801_access

From: Heiner Kallweit <hkallweit1@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 065b6211a87746e196b56759a70c7851418dd741 ]

As explained in [0] currently we may leave SMBHSTSTS_INUSE_STS set,
thus potentially breaking ACPI/BIOS usage of the SMBUS device.

Seems patch [0] needs a little bit more of review effort, therefore
I'd suggest to apply a part of it as quick win. Just clearing
SMBHSTSTS_INUSE_STS when leaving i801_access() should fix the
referenced issue and leaves more time for discussing a more
sophisticated locking handling.
