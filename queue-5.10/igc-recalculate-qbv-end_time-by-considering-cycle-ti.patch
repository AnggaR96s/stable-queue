Subject: igc: recalculate Qbv end_time by considering cycle time

From: Tan Tee Min <tee.min.tan@linux.intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 6d05251d537a4d3835959a8cdd8cbbbdcdc0c904 ]

Qbv users can specify a cycle time that is not equal to the total GCL
intervals. Hence, recalculation is necessary here to exclude the time
interval that exceeds the cycle time. As those GCL which exceeds the
cycle time will be truncated.

According to IEEE Std. 802.1Q-2018 section 8.6.9.2, once the end of
the list is reached, it will switch to the END_OF_CYCLE state and
leave the gates in the same state until the next cycle is started.
