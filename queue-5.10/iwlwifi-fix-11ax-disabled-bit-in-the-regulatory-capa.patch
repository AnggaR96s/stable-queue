Subject: iwlwifi: fix 11ax disabled bit in the regulatory capability flags

From: Luca Coelho <luciano.coelho@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 07cc40fec9a85e669ea12e161a438d2cbd76f1ed ]

When version 2 of the regulatory capability flags API was implemented,
the flag to disable 11ax was defined as bit 13, but this was later
changed and the bit remained as bit 10, like in version 1.  This was
never changed in the driver, so we were checking for the wrong bit in
newer devices.  Fix it.
