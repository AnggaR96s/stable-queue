Subject: kallsyms: fix nonconverging kallsyms table with lld

From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

[ Upstream commit efe6e3068067212b85c2d0474b5ee3b2d0c7adab ]

ARM randconfig builds with lld sometimes show a build failure
from kallsyms:

  Inconsistent kallsyms data
  Try make KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS=1 as a workaround

The problem is the veneers/thunks getting added by the linker extend
the symbol table, which in turn leads to more veneers being needed,
so it may take a few extra iterations to converge.

This bug has been fixed multiple times before, but comes back every time
a new symbol name is used. lld uses a different set of identifiers from
ld.bfd, so the additional ones need to be added as well.

I looked through the sources and found that arm64 and mips define similar
prefixes, so I'm adding those as well, aside from the ones I observed. I'm
not sure about powerpc64, which seems to already be handled through a
section match, but if it comes back, the "__long_branch_" and "__plt_"
prefixes would have to get added as well.
