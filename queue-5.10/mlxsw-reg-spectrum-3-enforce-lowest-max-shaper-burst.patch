Subject: mlxsw: reg: Spectrum-3: Enforce lowest max-shaper burst size of 11

From: Petr Machata <petrm@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit 306b9228c097b4101c150ccd262372ded8348644 ]

A max-shaper is the HW component responsible for delaying egress traffic
above a configured transmission rate. Burst size is the amount of traffic
that is allowed to pass without accounting. The burst size value needs to
be such that it can be expressed as 2^BS * 512 bits, where BS lies in a
certain ASIC-dependent range. mlxsw enforces that this holds before
attempting to configure the shaper.

The assumption for Spectrum-3 was that the lower limit of BS would be 5,
like for Spectrum-1. But as of now, the limit is still 11. Therefore fix
the driver accordingly, so that incorrect values are rejected early with a
proper message.
