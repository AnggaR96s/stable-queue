Subject: mm/khugepaged: take the right locks for page table retraction

From: Jann Horn <jannh@google.com>

commit 8d3c106e19e8d251da31ff4cc7462e4565d65084 upstream.

pagetable walks on address ranges mapped by VMAs can be done under the
mmap lock, the lock of an anon_vma attached to the VMA, or the lock of the
VMA's address_space.  Only one of these needs to be held, and it does not
need to be held in exclusive mode.

Under those circumstances, the rules for concurrent access to page table
entries are:

 - Terminal page table entries (entries that don't point to another page
   table) can be arbitrarily changed under the page table lock, with the
   exception that they always need to be consistent for
   hardware page table walks and lockless_pages_from_mm().
   This includes that they can be changed into non-terminal entries.
 - Non-terminal page table entries (which point to another page table)
   can not be modified; readers are allowed to READ_ONCE() an entry, verify
   that it is non-terminal, and then assume that its value will stay as-is.

Retracting a page table involves modifying a non-terminal entry, so
page-table-level locks are insufficient to protect against concurrent page
table traversal; it requires taking all the higher-level locks under which
it is possible to start a page walk in the relevant range in exclusive
mode.

The collapse_huge_page() path for anonymous THP already follows this rule,
but the shmem/file THP path was getting it wrong, making it possible for
concurrent rmap-based operations to cause corruption.
