Subject: net: bridge: Clear offload_fwd_mark when passing frame up bridge
 interface.

From: Andrew Lunn <andrew@lunn.ch>

[ Upstream commit fbb3abdf2223cd0dfc07de85fe5a43ba7f435bdf ]

It is possible to stack bridges on top of each other. Consider the
following which makes use of an Ethernet switch:

       br1
     /    \
    /      \
   /        \
 br0.11    wlan0
   |
   br0
 /  |  \
p1  p2  p3

br0 is offloaded to the switch. Above br0 is a vlan interface, for
vlan 11. This vlan interface is then a slave of br1. br1 also has a
wireless interface as a slave. This setup trunks wireless lan traffic
over the copper network inside a VLAN.

A frame received on p1 which is passed up to the bridge has the
skb->offload_fwd_mark flag set to true, indicating that the switch has
dealt with forwarding the frame out ports p2 and p3 as needed. This
flag instructs the software bridge it does not need to pass the frame
back down again. However, the flag is not getting reset when the frame
is passed upwards. As a result br1 sees the flag, wrongly interprets
it, and fails to forward the frame to wlan0.

When passing a frame upwards, clear the flag. This is the Rx
equivalent of br_switchdev_frame_unmark() in br_dev_xmit().
