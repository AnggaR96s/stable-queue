Subject: nvme: only allow entering LIVE from CONNECTING state

From: Daniel Wagner <wagi@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit d2fe192348f93fe3a0cb1e33e4aba58e646397f4 ]

The fabric transports and also the PCI transport are not entering the
LIVE state from NEW or RESETTING. This makes the state machine more
restrictive and allows to catch not supported state transitions, e.g.
directly switching from RESETTING to LIVE.
