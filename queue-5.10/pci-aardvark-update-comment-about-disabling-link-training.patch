Subject: PCI: aardvark: Update comment about disabling link training
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

commit 1d1cd163d0de22a4041a6f1aeabcf78f80076539 upstream.

According to PCI Express Base Specifications (rev 4.0, 6.6.1
"Conventional reset"), after fundamental reset a 100ms delay is needed
prior to enabling link training.

Update comment in code to reflect this requirement.
