Subject: PCI: endpoint: Make *_get_first_free_bar() take into account 64 bit
 BAR

From: Kishon Vijay Abraham I <kishon@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit 959a48d0eac0321948c9f3d1707ba22c100e92d5 ]

pci_epc_get_first_free_bar() uses only "reserved_bar" member in
epc_features to get the first unreserved BAR. However if the reserved BAR
is also a 64-bit BAR, then the next BAR shouldn't be returned (since 64-bit
BAR uses two BARs).

Make pci_epc_get_first_free_bar() take into account 64 bit BAR while
returning the first free unreserved BAR.
