Subject: perf kcore_copy: Do not check /proc/modules is unchanged

From: Adrian Hunter <adrian.hunter@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 5b427df27b94aec1312cace48a746782a0925c53 ]

/proc/kallsyms and /proc/modules are compared before and after the copy
in order to ensure no changes during the copy.

However /proc/modules also might change due to reference counts changing
even though that does not make any difference.

Any modules loaded or unloaded should be visible in changes to kallsyms,
so it is not necessary to check /proc/modules also anyway.

Remove the comparison checking that /proc/modules is unchanged.

Fixes: fc1b691d7651d949 ("perf buildid-cache: Add ability to add kcore to the cache")
