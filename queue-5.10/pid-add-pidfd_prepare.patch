Subject: pid: add pidfd_prepare()

From: Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>

commit 6ae930d9dbf2d093157be33428538c91966d8a9f upstream.

Add a new helper that allows to reserve a pidfd and allocates a new
pidfd file that stashes the provided struct pid. This will allow us to
remove places that either open code this function or that call
pidfd_create() but then have to call close_fd() because there are still
failure points after pidfd_create() has been called.
