Subject: PM: sleep: Use bool for all 1-bit fields in struct dev_pm_info

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit b017500ab53c06441ff7d3a681484e37039b4f57 ]

For some 1-bit fields in struct dev_pm_info the data type is bool, while
for some other 1-bit fields in there it is unsigned int, and these
differences are somewhat arbitrary.

For consistency, change the data type of the latter to bool, so that all
of the 1-bit fields in struct dev_pm_info fields are bool.

No intentional functional impact.
