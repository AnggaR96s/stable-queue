Subject: powerpc/vmlinux.lds: Define RUNTIME_DISCARD_EXIT

From: Michael Ellerman <mpe@ellerman.id.au>

commit 4b9880dbf3bdba3a7c56445137c3d0e30aaa0a40 upstream.

The powerpc linker script explicitly includes .exit.text, because
otherwise the link fails due to references from __bug_table and
__ex_table. The code is freed (discarded) at runtime along with
.init.text and data.

That has worked in the past despite powerpc not defining
RUNTIME_DISCARD_EXIT because DISCARDS appears late in the powerpc linker
script (line 410), and the explicit inclusion of .exit.text
earlier (line 280) supersedes the discard.

However commit 99cb0d917ffa ("arch: fix broken BuildID for arm64 and
riscv") introduced an earlier use of DISCARD as part of the RO_DATA
macro (line 136). With binutils < 2.36 that causes the DISCARD
directives later in the script to be applied earlier [1], causing
.exit.text to actually be discarded at link time, leading to build
errors:

  '.exit.text' referenced in section '__bug_table' of crypto/algboss.o: defined in
  discarded section '.exit.text' of crypto/algboss.o
  '.exit.text' referenced in section '__ex_table' of drivers/nvdimm/core.o: defined in
  discarded section '.exit.text' of drivers/nvdimm/core.o

Fix it by defining RUNTIME_DISCARD_EXIT, which causes the generic
DISCARDS macro to not include .exit.text at all.
