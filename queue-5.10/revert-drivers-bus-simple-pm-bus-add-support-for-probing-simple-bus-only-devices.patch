From: Kevin Hilman <khilman@baylibre.com>

This reverts commit d5f13bbb51046537b2c2b9868177fb8fe8a6a6e9 which is
commit 98e96cf80045a383fcc47c58dd4e87b3ae587b3e upstream.

This change related to fw_devlink was backported to v5.10 but has
severaly other dependencies that were not backported.  As discussed
with the original author, the best approach for v5.10 is to revert.
