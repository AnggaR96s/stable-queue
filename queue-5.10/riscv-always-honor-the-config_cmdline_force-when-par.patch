Subject: riscv: always honor the CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE when parsing dtb

[ Upstream commit 10f6913c548b32ecb73801a16b120e761c6957ea ]

When CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE is enabled, cmdline provided by
CONFIG_CMDLINE are always used. This allows CONFIG_CMDLINE to be
used regardless of the result of device tree scanning.

This especially fixes the case where a device tree without the
chosen node is supplied to the kernel. In such cases,
early_init_dt_scan would return true. But inside
early_init_dt_scan_chosen, the cmdline won't be updated as there
is no chosen node in the device tree. As a result, CONFIG_CMDLINE
is not copied into boot_command_line even if CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE
is enabled. This commit allows properly update boot_command_line
in this situation.
