Subject: sched/fair: Fix per-CPU kthread and wakee stacking for asym CPU
 capacity

From: Vincent Donnefort <vincent.donnefort@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 014ba44e8184e1acf93e0cbb7089ee847802f8f0 ]

select_idle_sibling() has a special case for tasks woken up by a per-CPU
kthread where the selected CPU is the previous one. For asymmetric CPU
capacity systems, the assumption was that the wakee couldn't have a
bigger utilization during task placement than it used to have during the
last activation. That was not considering uclamp.min which can completely
change between two task activations and as a consequence mandates the
fitness criterion asym_fits_capacity(), even for the exit path described
above.

Fixes: b4c9c9f15649 ("sched/fair: Prefer prev cpu in asymmetric wakeup path")
