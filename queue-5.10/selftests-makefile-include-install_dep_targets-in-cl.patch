Subject: selftests/Makefile: include $(INSTALL_DEP_TARGETS) in clean target to
 clean net/lib dependency

From: Nai-Chen Cheng <bleach1827@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit d3f7457da7b9527a06dbcbfaf666aa51ac2eeb53 ]

The selftests 'make clean' does not clean the net/lib because it only
processes $(TARGETS) and ignores $(INSTALL_DEP_TARGETS). This leaves
compiled objects in net/lib after cleaning, requiring manual cleanup.

Include $(INSTALL_DEP_TARGETS) in clean target to ensure net/lib
dependency is properly cleaned.
