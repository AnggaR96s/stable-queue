Subject: tracing: relax trace_event_eval_update() execution with
 cond_resched()

[ Upstream commit 23cce5f25491968b23fb9c399bbfb25f13870cd9 ]

When kernel is compiled without preemption, the eval_map_work_func()
(which calls trace_event_eval_update()) will not be preempted up to its
complete execution. This can actually cause a problem since if another
CPU call stop_machine(), the call will have to wait for the
eval_map_work_func() function to finish executing in the workqueue
before being able to be scheduled. This problem was observe on a SMP
system at boot time, when the CPU calling the initcalls executed
clocksource_done_booting() which in the end calls stop_machine(). We
observed a 1 second delay because one CPU was executing
eval_map_work_func() and was not preempted by the stop_machine() task.

Adding a call to cond_resched() in trace_event_eval_update() allows
other tasks to be executed and thus continue working asynchronously
like before without blocking any pending task at boot time.
