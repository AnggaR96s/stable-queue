Subject: vfio/mdev: Make to_mdev_device() into a static inline

From: Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit 66873b5fa738ca02b5c075ca4a410b13d88e6e9a ]

The macro wrongly uses 'dev' as both the macro argument and the member
name, which means it fails compilation if any caller uses a word other
than 'dev' as the single argument. Fix this defect by making it into
proper static inline, which is more clear and typesafe anyhow.

Fixes: 99e3123e3d72 ("vfio-mdev: Make mdev_device private and abstract interfaces")
