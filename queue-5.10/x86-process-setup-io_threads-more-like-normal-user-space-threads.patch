Subject: x86/process: setup io_threads more like normal user space threads

From: Stefan Metzmacher <metze@samba.org>

[ Upstream commit 50b7b6f29de3e18e9d6c09641256a0296361cfee ]

As io_threads are fully set up USER threads it's clearer to separate the
code path from the KTHREAD logic.

The only remaining difference to user space threads is that io_threads
never return to user space again. Instead they loop within the given
worker function.

The fact that they never return to user space means they don't have an
user space thread stack. In order to indicate that to tools like gdb we
reset the stack and instruction pointers to 0.

This allows gdb attach to user space processes using io-uring, which like
means that they have io_threads, without printing worrying message like
this:

  warning: Selected architecture i386:x86-64 is not compatible with reported target architecture i386

  warning: Architecture rejected target-supplied description

The output will be something like this:

  (gdb) info threads
    Id   Target Id                  Frame
