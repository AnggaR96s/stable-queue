Subject: x86/resctrl: Use task_curr() instead of task_struct->on_cpu to
 prevent unnecessary IPI

From: Reinette Chatre <reinette.chatre@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit e0ad6dc8969f790f14bddcfd7ea284b7e5f88a16 ]

James reported in [1] that there could be two tasks running on the same CPU
with task_struct->on_cpu set. Using task_struct->on_cpu as a test if a task
is running on a CPU may thus match the old task for a CPU while the
scheduler is running and IPI it unnecessarily.

task_curr() is the correct helper to use. While doing so move the #ifdef
check of the CONFIG_SMP symbol to be a C conditional used to determine
if this helper should be used to ensure the code is always checked for
correctness by the compiler.
