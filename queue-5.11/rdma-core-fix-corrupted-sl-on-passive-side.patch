[ Upstream commit 194f64a3cad3ab9e381e996a13089de3215d1887 ]

On RoCE systems, a CM REQ contains a Primary Hop Limit > 1 and Primary
Subnet Local is zero.

In cm_req_handler(), the cm_process_routed_req() function is called. Since
the Primary Subnet Local value is zero in the request, and since this is
RoCE (Primary Local LID is permissive), the following statement will be
executed:

      IBA_SET(CM_REQ_PRIMARY_SL, req_msg, wc->sl);

This corrupts SL in req_msg if it was different from zero. In other words,
a request to setup a connection using an SL != zero, will not be honored,
and a connection using SL zero will be created instead.

Fixed by not calling cm_process_routed_req() on RoCE systems, the
cm_process_route_req() is only for IB anyhow.

Fixes: 3971c9f6dbf2 ("IB/cm: Add interim support for routed paths")
