Subject: mm, thp: use head page in __migration_entry_wait()

From: Xu Yu <xuyu@linux.alibaba.com>

commit ffc90cbb2970ab88b66ea51dd580469eede57b67 upstream.

We notice that hung task happens in a corner but practical scenario when
CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE is enabled, as follows.

Process 0                       Process 1                     Process 2..Inf
split_huge_page_to_list
    unmap_page
        split_huge_pmd_address
                                __migration_entry_wait(head)
                                                              __migration_entry_wait(tail)
    remap_page (roll back)
        remove_migration_ptes
            rmap_walk_anon
                cond_resched

Where __migration_entry_wait(tail) is occurred in kernel space, e.g.,
copy_to_user in fstat, which will immediately fault again without
rescheduling, and thus occupy the cpu fully.

When there are too many processes performing __migration_entry_wait on
tail page, remap_page will never be done after cond_resched.

This makes __migration_entry_wait operate on the compound head page,
thus waits for remap_page to complete, whether the THP is split
successfully or roll back.

Note that put_and_wait_on_page_locked helps to drop the page reference
acquired with get_page_unless_zero, as soon as the page is on the wait
queue, before actually waiting.  So splitting the THP is only prevented
for a brief interval.
