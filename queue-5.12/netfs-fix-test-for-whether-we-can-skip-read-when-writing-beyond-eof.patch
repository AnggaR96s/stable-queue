Subject: netfs: fix test for whether we can skip read when writing beyond EOF

From: Jeff Layton <jlayton@kernel.org>

commit 827a746f405d25f79560c7868474aec5aee174e1 upstream.

It's not sufficient to skip reading when the pos is beyond the EOF.
There may be data at the head of the page that we need to fill in
before the write.

Add a new helper function that corrects and clarifies the logic of
when we can skip reads, and have it only zero out the part of the page
that won't have data copied in for the write.

Finally, don't set the page Uptodate after zeroing. It's not up to date
since the write data won't have been copied in yet.

[DH made the following changes:

 - Prefixed the new function with "netfs_".

 - Don't call zero_user_segments() for a full-page write.

 - Altered the beyond-last-page check to avoid a DIV instruction and got
   rid of then-redundant zero-length file check.
]

[ Note: this fix is commit 827a746f405d in mainline kernels. The
	original bug was in ceph, but got lifted into the fs/netfs
	library for v5.13. This backport should apply to stable
	kernels v5.10 though v5.12. ]
