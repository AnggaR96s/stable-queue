Subject: PM / devfreq: Use more accurate returned new_freq as resume_freq

From: Dong Aisheng <aisheng.dong@nxp.com>

[ Upstream commit 62453f1ba5d5def9d58e140a50f3f168f028da38 ]

Use the more accurate returned new_freq as resume_freq.
It's the same as how devfreq->previous_freq was updated.

Fixes: 83f8ca45afbf0 ("PM / devfreq: add support for suspend/resume of a devfreq device")
