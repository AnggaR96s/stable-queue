Subject: hugetlb: address ref count racing in prep_compound_gigantic_page

From: Mike Kravetz <mike.kravetz@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit 7118fc2906e2925d7edb5ed9c8a57f2a5f23b849 ]

In [1], Jann Horn points out a possible race between
prep_compound_gigantic_page and __page_cache_add_speculative.  The root
cause of the possible race is prep_compound_gigantic_page uncondittionally
setting the ref count of pages to zero.  It does this because
prep_compound_gigantic_page is handed a 'group' of pages from an allocator
and needs to convert that group of pages to a compound page.  The ref
count of each page in this 'group' is one as set by the allocator.
However, the ref count of compound page tail pages must be zero.

The potential race comes about when ref counted pages are returned from
the allocator.  When this happens, other mm code could also take a
reference on the page.  __page_cache_add_speculative is one such example.
Therefore, prep_compound_gigantic_page can not just set the ref count of
pages to zero as it does today.  Doing so would lose the reference taken
by any other code.  This would lead to BUGs in code checking ref counts
and could possibly even lead to memory corruption.

There are two possible ways to address this issue.

1) Make all allocators of gigantic groups of pages be able to return a
   properly constructed compound page.

2) Make prep_compound_gigantic_page be more careful when constructing a
   compound page.

This patch takes approach 2.

In prep_compound_gigantic_page, use cmpxchg to only set ref count to zero
if it is one.  If the cmpxchg fails, call synchronize_rcu() in the hope
that the extra ref count will be driopped during a rcu grace period.  This
is not a performance critical code path and the wait should be
accceptable.  If the ref count is still inflated after the grace period,
then undo any modifications made and return an error.

Currently prep_compound_gigantic_page is type void and does not return
errors.  Modify the two callers to check for and handle error returns.  On
error, the caller must free the 'group' of pages as they can not be used
to form a gigantic page.  After freeing pages, the runtime caller
(alloc_fresh_huge_page) will retry the allocation once.  Boot time
allocations can not be retried.

The routine prep_compound_page also unconditionally sets the ref count of
compound page tail pages to zero.  However, in this case the buddy
allocator is constructing a compound page from freshly allocated pages.
The ref count on those freshly allocated pages is already zero, so the
set_page_count(p, 0) is unnecessary and could lead to confusion.  Just
remove it.
