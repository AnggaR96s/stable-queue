Subject: mm/page_alloc: correct return value of populated elements if bulk array is populated

From: Mel Gorman <mgorman@techsingularity.net>

commit ff4b2b4014cbffb3d32b22629252f4dc8616b0fe upstream.

Dave Jones reported the following

	This made it into 5.13 final, and completely breaks NFSD for me
	(Serving tcp v3 mounts).  Existing mounts on clients hang, as do
	new mounts from new clients.  Rebooting the server back to rc7
	everything recovers.

The commit b3b64ebd3822 ("mm/page_alloc: do bulk array bounds check after
checking populated elements") returns the wrong value if the array is
already populated which is interpreted as an allocation failure.  Dave
reported this fixes his problem and it also passed a test running dbench
over NFS.
