Subject: net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Update mv88e6393x serdes errata

From: Nathan Rossi <nathan.rossi@digi.com>

[ Upstream commit 3b0720ba00a7413997ad331838d22c81f252556a ]

In early erratas this issue only covered port 0 when changing from
[x]MII (rev A 3.6). In subsequent errata versions this errata changed to
cover the additional "Hardware reset in CPU managed mode" condition, and
removed the note specifying that it only applied to port 0.

In designs where the device is configured with CPU managed mode
(CPU_MGD), on reset all SERDES ports (p0, p9, p10) have a stuck power
down bit and require this initial power up procedure. As such apply this
errata to all three SERDES ports of the mv88e6393x.
