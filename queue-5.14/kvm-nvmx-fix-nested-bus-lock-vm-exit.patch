Subject: KVM: nVMX: Fix nested bus lock VM exit

From: Chenyi Qiang <chenyi.qiang@intel.com>

commit 24a996ade34d00deef5dee2c33aacd8fda91ec31 upstream.

Nested bus lock VM exits are not supported yet. If L2 triggers bus lock
VM exit, it will be directed to L1 VMM, which would cause unexpected
behavior. Therefore, handle L2's bus lock VM exits in L0 directly.

Fixes: fe6b6bc802b4 ("KVM: VMX: Enable bus lock VM exit")
