[ Upstream commit 3f100f524e75586537e337b34d18c8d604b398e7 ]

For the classic snd_hda_intel driver, codec->card and bus->card point to
the exact same thing. When snd_card_diconnect() fires, bus->shutdown is
set thanks to azx_dev_disconnect(). card->shutdown is already set when
that happens but both provide basically the same functionality.

For the DSP snd_soc_avs driver where multiple codecs are located on
multiple cards, bus->shutdown 'shortcut' is not sufficient. One codec
card may be unregistered while other codecs are still operational.
Proper check in form of card->shutdown must be used to verify whether
the codec's card is being shut down.
