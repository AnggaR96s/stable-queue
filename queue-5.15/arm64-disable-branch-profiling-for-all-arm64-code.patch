Subject: arm64: Disable branch profiling for all arm64 code

From: Breno Leitao <leitao@debian.org>

[ Upstream commit f22c81bebf8bda6e54dc132df0ed54f6bf8756f9 ]

The arm64 kernel doesn't boot with annotated branches
(PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES) enabled and CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL together.

Bisecting it, I found that disabling branch profiling in arch/arm64/mm
solved the problem. Narrowing down a bit further, I found that
physaddr.c is the file that needs to have branch profiling disabled to
get the machine to boot.

I suspect that it might invoke some ftrace helper very early in the boot
process and ftrace is still not enabled(!?).

Rather than playing whack-a-mole with individual files, disable branch
profiling for the entire arch/arm64 tree, similar to what x86 already
does in arch/x86/Kbuild.
