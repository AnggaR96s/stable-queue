Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sdm630: fix gpu_speed_bin size

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@oss.qualcomm.com>

[ Upstream commit e814796dfcae8905682ac3ac2dd57f512a9f6726 ]

Historically sdm630.dtsi has used 1 byte length for the gpu_speed_bin
cell, although it spans two bytes (offset 5, size 7 bits). It was being
accepted by the kernel because before the commit 7a06ef751077 ("nvmem:
core: fix bit offsets of more than one byte") the kernel didn't have
length check. After this commit nvmem core rejects QFPROM on sdm630 /
sdm660, making GPU and USB unusable on those platforms.

Set the size of the gpu_speed_bin cell to 2 bytes, fixing the parsing
error. While we are at it, update the length to 8 bits as pointed out by
Alexey Minnekhanov.

Fixes: b190fb010664 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sdm630: Add sdm630 dts file")
