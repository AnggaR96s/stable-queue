Subject: bpf: ensure main program has an extable

From: Krister Johansen <kjlx@templeofstupid.com>

commit 0108a4e9f3584a7a2c026d1601b0682ff7335d95 upstream.

When subprograms are in use, the main program is not jit'd after the
subprograms because jit_subprogs sets a value for prog->bpf_func upon
success.  Subsequent calls to the JIT are bypassed when this value is
non-NULL.  This leads to a situation where the main program and its
func[0] counterpart are both in the bpf kallsyms tree, but only func[0]
has an extable.  Extables are only created during JIT.  Now there are
two nearly identical program ksym entries in the tree, but only one has
an extable.  Depending upon how the entries are placed, there's a chance
that a fault will call search_extable on the aux with the NULL entry.

Since jit_subprogs already copies state from func[0] to the main
program, include the extable pointer in this state duplication.
Additionally, ensure that the copy of the main program in func[0] is not
added to the bpf_prog_kallsyms table. Instead, let the main program get
added later in bpf_prog_load().  This ensures there is only a single
copy of the main program in the kallsyms table, and that its tag matches
the tag observed by tooling like bpftool.
