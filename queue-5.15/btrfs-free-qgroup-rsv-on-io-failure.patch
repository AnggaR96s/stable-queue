Subject: btrfs: free qgroup rsv on io failure

From: Boris Burkov <boris@bur.io>

commit e28b02118b94e42be3355458a2406c6861e2dd32 upstream.

If we do a write whose bio suffers an error, we will never reclaim the
qgroup reserved space for it. We allocate the space in the write_iter
codepath, then release the reservation as we allocate the ordered
extent, but we only create a delayed ref if the ordered extent finishes.
If it has an error, we simply leak the rsv. This is apparent in running
any error injecting (dmerror) fstests like btrfs/146 or btrfs/160. Such
tests fail due to dmesg on umount complaining about the leaked qgroup
data space.

When we clean up other aspects of space on failed ordered_extents, also
free the qgroup rsv.
