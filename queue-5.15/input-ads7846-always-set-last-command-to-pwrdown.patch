Subject: Input: ads7846 - always set last command to PWRDOWN

From: Luca Ellero <l.ellero@asem.it>

[ Upstream commit 13f82ca3878db8284a70ef9711d7f710a31eb562 ]

Controllers that report pressure (e.g. ADS7846) use 5 commands and the
correct sequence is READ_X, READ_Y, READ_Z1, READ_Z2, PWRDOWN.

Controllers that don't report pressure (e.g. ADS7845/ADS7843) use only 3
commands and the correct sequence should be READ_X, READ_Y, PWRDOWN. But
the sequence sent was incorrect: READ_X, READ_Y, READ_Z1.

Fix this by setting the third (and last) command to PWRDOWN.
