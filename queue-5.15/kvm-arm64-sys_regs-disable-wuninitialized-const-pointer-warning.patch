A new warning in Clang 22 [1] complains that @clidr passed to
get_clidr_el1() is an uninitialized const pointer. get_clidr_el1()
doesn't really care since it casts away the const-ness anyways -- it is
a false positive.

|  ../arch/arm64/kvm/sys_regs.c:2838:23: warning: variable 'clidr' is uninitialized when passed as a const pointer argument here [-Wuninitialized-const-pointer]
|   2838 |         get_clidr_el1(NULL, &clidr); /* Ugly... */
|        |                              ^~~~~

This patch isn't needed for anything past 6.1 as this code section was
reworked in Commit 7af0c2534f4c ("KVM: arm64: Normalize cache
configuration"). Since there is no upstream equivalent, this patch just
needs to be applied to 5.15.

Disable this warning for sys_regs.o with an iron fist as it doesn't make
sense to waste maintainer's time or potentially break builds by
backporting large changelists from 6.2+.
