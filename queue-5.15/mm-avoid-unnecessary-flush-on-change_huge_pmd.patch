Subject: mm: avoid unnecessary flush on change_huge_pmd()

From: Nadav Amit <namit@vmware.com>

[ Upstream commit 4f83145721f362c2f4d312edc4755269a2069488 ]

Calls to change_protection_range() on THP can trigger, at least on x86,
two TLB flushes for one page: one immediately, when pmdp_invalidate() is
called by change_huge_pmd(), and then another one later (that can be
batched) when change_protection_range() finishes.

The first TLB flush is only necessary to prevent the dirty bit (and with a
lesser importance the access bit) from changing while the PTE is modified.
However, this is not necessary as the x86 CPUs set the dirty-bit
atomically with an additional check that the PTE is (still) present.  One
caveat is Intel's Knights Landing that has a bug and does not do so.

Leverage this behavior to eliminate the unnecessary TLB flush in
change_huge_pmd().  Introduce a new arch specific pmdp_invalidate_ad()
that only invalidates the access and dirty bit from further changes.
