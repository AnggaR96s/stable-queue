commit 8caa81eb950cb2e9d2d6959b37d853162d197f57 upstream.

The driver only supports normal polarity. Complete the implementation of
.get_state() by setting .polarity accordingly.

This fixes a regression that was possible since commit c73a3107624d
("pwm: Handle .get_state() failures") which stopped to zero-initialize
the state passed to the .get_state() callback. This was reported at
https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=177&t=46360 . While this was an
unintended side effect, the real issue is the driver's callback not
setting the polarity.

There is a complicating fact, that the .apply() callback fakes support
for inversed polarity. This is not (and cannot) be matched by
.get_state(). As fixing this isn't easy, only point it out in a comment
to prevent authors of other drivers from copying that approach.

Fixes: c375bcbaabdb ("pwm: meson: Read the full hardware state in meson_pwm_get_state()")
