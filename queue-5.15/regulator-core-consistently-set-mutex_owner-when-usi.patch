Subject: regulator: core: Consistently set mutex_owner when using
 ww_mutex_lock_slow()

From: Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>

[ Upstream commit b83a1772be854f87602de14726737d3e5b06e1f4 ]

When a codepath locks a rdev using ww_mutex_lock_slow() directly then
that codepath is responsible for incrementing the "ref_cnt" and also
setting the "mutex_owner" to "current".

The regulator core consistently got that right for "ref_cnt" but
didn't always get it right for "mutex_owner". Let's fix this.

It's unlikely that this truly matters because the "mutex_owner" is
only needed if we're going to do subsequent locking of the same
rdev. However, even though it's not truly needed it seems less
surprising if we consistently set "mutex_owner" properly.

Fixes: f8702f9e4aa7 ("regulator: core: Use ww_mutex for regulators locking")
