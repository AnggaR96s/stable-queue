Subject: sched: Change nr_uninterruptible type to unsigned long

From: Aruna Ramakrishna <aruna.ramakrishna@oracle.com>

commit 36569780b0d64de283f9d6c2195fd1a43e221ee8 upstream.

The commit e6fe3f422be1 ("sched: Make multiple runqueue task counters
32-bit") changed nr_uninterruptible to an unsigned int. But the
nr_uninterruptible values for each of the CPU runqueues can grow to
large numbers, sometimes exceeding INT_MAX. This is valid, if, over
time, a large number of tasks are migrated off of one CPU after going
into an uninterruptible state. Only the sum of all nr_interruptible
values across all CPUs yields the correct result, as explained in a
comment in kernel/sched/loadavg.c.

Change the type of nr_uninterruptible back to unsigned long to prevent
overflows, and thus the miscalculation of load average.

Fixes: e6fe3f422be1 ("sched: Make multiple runqueue task counters 32-bit")
