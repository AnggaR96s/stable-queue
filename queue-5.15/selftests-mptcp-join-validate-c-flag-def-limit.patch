From: "Matthieu Baerts (NGI0)" <matttbe@kernel.org>

commit 008385efd05e04d8dff299382df2e8be0f91d8a0 upstream.

The previous commit adds an exception for the C-flag case. The
'mptcp_join.sh' selftest is extended to validate this case.

In this subtest, there is a typical CDN deployment with a client where
MPTCP endpoints have been 'automatically' configured:

- the server set net.mptcp.allow_join_initial_addr_port=0

- the client has multiple 'subflow' endpoints, and the default limits:
  not accepting ADD_ADDRs.

Without the parent patch, the client is not able to establish new
subflows using its 'subflow' endpoints. The parent commit fixes that.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.

Fixes: df377be38725 ("mptcp: add deny_join_id0 in mptcp_options_received")

[ Conflicts in mptcp_join.sh, because many different helpers have been
  modified in newer kernel versions, e.g. in commit 03668c65d153
  ("selftests: mptcp: join: rework detailed report"), or commit
  985de45923e2 ("selftests: mptcp: centralize stats dumping"), etc.
  Adaptations have been made to use the old way, similar to what is done
  just above. ]
