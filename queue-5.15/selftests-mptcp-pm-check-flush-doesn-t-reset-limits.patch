Subject: selftests: mptcp: pm: check flush doesn't reset limits

From: Matthieu Baerts (NGI0) <matttbe@kernel.org>

commit 452690be7de2f91cc0de68cb9e95252875b33503 upstream.

This modification is linked to the parent commit where the received
ADD_ADDR limit was accidentally reset when the endpoints were flushed.

To validate that, the test is now flushing endpoints after having set
new limits, and before checking them.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.

[ Conflicts in pm_netlink.sh, because some refactoring have been done
  later on: commit 3188309c8ceb ("selftests: mptcp: netlink:
  add 'limits' helpers") and commit c99d57d0007a ("selftests: mptcp: use
  pm_nl endpoint ops") are not in this version. The same operation can
  still be done at the same place, without using the new helper. ]
