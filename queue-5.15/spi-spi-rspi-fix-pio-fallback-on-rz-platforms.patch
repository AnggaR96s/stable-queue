Subject: spi: spi-rspi: Fix PIO fallback on RZ platforms

From: Biju Das <biju.das.jz@bp.renesas.com>

[ Upstream commit b620aa3a7be346f04ae7789b165937615c6ee8d3 ]

RSPI IP on RZ/{A, G2L} SoC's has the same signal for both interrupt
and DMA transfer request. Setting DMARS register for DMA transfer
makes the signal to work as a DMA transfer request signal and
subsequent interrupt requests to the interrupt controller
are masked.

PIO fallback does not work as interrupt signal is disabled.

This patch fixes this issue by re-enabling the interrupts by
calling dmaengine_synchronize().
