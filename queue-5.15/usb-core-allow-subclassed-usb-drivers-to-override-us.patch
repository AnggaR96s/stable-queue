Subject: usb: core: Allow subclassed USB drivers to override
 usb_choose_configuration()

From: Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>

[ Upstream commit a87b8e3be926af0fc3b9b1af42b1127bd1ff077c ]

For some USB devices we might want to do something different for
usb_choose_configuration(). One example here is the r8152 driver where
we want to end up using the vendor driver with the preferred
interface.

The r8152 driver tried to make things work by implementing a USB
generic_subclass driver and then overriding the normal config
selection after it happened. This is less than ideal and also caused
breakage if someone deauthorized and re-authorized the USB device
because the USB core ended up going back to it's default logic for
choosing the best config. I made an attempt to fix this [1] but it was
a bit ugly.

Let's do this better and allow USB generic_subclass drivers to
override usb_choose_configuration().
