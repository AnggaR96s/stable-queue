Subject: xfs: purge dquots after inode walk fails during quotacheck

From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 86d40f1e49e9a909d25c35ba01bea80dbcd758cb ]

xfs/434 and xfs/436 have been reporting occasional memory leaks of
xfs_dquot objects.  These tests themselves were the messenger, not the
culprit, since they unload the xfs module, which trips the slub
debugging code while tearing down all the xfs slab caches:

Since we don't generally rmmod the xfs module between fstests, this
means that xfs/434 is really just the canary in the coal mine --
something leaked a dquot, but we don't know who.  After days of pounding
on fstests with kmemleak enabled, I finally got it to spit this out:

Now we know that quotacheck is at fault, but even this report was
canaryish -- it was triggered by xfs/494, which doesn't actually mount
any filesystems.  (kmemleak can be a little slow to notice leaks, even
with fstests repeatedly whacking it to look for them.)  Looking at the
*previous* fstest, however, showed that the test run before xfs/494 was
xfs/117.  The tipoff to the problem is in this excerpt from dmesg:

XFS (sda4): Quotacheck: Unsuccessful (Error -117): Disabling quotas.

The dinode verifier decided that the inode was corrupt, which causes
iget to return with EFSCORRUPTED.  Since this happened during
quotacheck, it is obvious that the kernel aborted the inode walk on
account of the corruption error and disabled quotas.  Unfortunately, we
neglect to purge the dquot cache before doing that, which is how the
dquots leaked.

The problems started 10 years ago in commit b84a3a, when the dquot lists
were converted to a radix tree, but the error handling behavior was not
correctly preserved -- in that commit, if the bulkstat failed and
usrquota was enabled, the bulkstat failure code would be overwritten by
the result of flushing all the dquots to disk.  As long as that
succeeds, we'd continue the quota mount as if everything were ok, but
instead we're now operating with a corrupt inode and incorrect quota
usage counts.  I didn't notice this bug in 2019 when I wrote commit
ebd126a, which changed quotacheck to skip the dqflush when the scan
doesn't complete due to inode walk failures.
