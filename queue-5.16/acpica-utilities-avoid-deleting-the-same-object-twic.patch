Subject: ACPICA: Utilities: Avoid deleting the same object twice in a row

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 1cdfe9e346b4c5509ffe19ccde880fd259d9f7a3 ]

ACPICA commit c11af67d8f7e3d381068ce7771322f2b5324d687

If original_count is 0 in acpi_ut_update_ref_count (),
acpi_ut_delete_internal_obj () is invoked for the target object, which is
incorrect, because that object has been deleted once already and the
memory allocated to store it may have been reclaimed and allocated
for a different purpose by the host OS.  Moreover, a confusing debug
message following the "Reference Count is already zero, cannot
decrement" warning is printed in that case.

To fix this issue, make acpi_ut_update_ref_count () return after finding
that original_count is 0 and printing the above warning.
