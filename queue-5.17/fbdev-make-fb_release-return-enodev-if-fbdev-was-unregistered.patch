Subject: fbdev: Make fb_release() return -ENODEV if fbdev was unregistered

From: Javier Martinez Canillas <javierm@redhat.com>

commit aafa025c76dcc7d1a8c8f0bdefcbe4eb480b2f6a upstream.

A reference to the framebuffer device struct fb_info is stored in the file
private data, but this reference could no longer be valid and must not be
accessed directly. Instead, the file_fb_info() accessor function must be
used since it does sanity checking to make sure that the fb_info is valid.

This can happen for example if the registered framebuffer device is for a
driver that just uses a framebuffer provided by the system firmware. In
that case, the fbdev core would unregister the framebuffer device when a
real video driver is probed and ask to remove conflicting framebuffers.

The bug has been present for a long time but commit 27599aacbaef ("fbdev:
Hot-unplug firmware fb devices on forced removal") unmasked it since the
fbdev core started unregistering the framebuffers' devices associated.

Fixes: 27599aacbaef ("fbdev: Hot-unplug firmware fb devices on forced removal")
