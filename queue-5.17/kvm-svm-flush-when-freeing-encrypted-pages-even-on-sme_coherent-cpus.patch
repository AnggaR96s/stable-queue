Subject: KVM: SVM: Flush when freeing encrypted pages even on SME_COHERENT CPUs

From: Mingwei Zhang <mizhang@google.com>

commit d45829b351ee6ec5f54dd55e6aca1f44fe239fe6 upstream.

Use clflush_cache_range() to flush the confidential memory when
SME_COHERENT is supported in AMD CPU. Cache flush is still needed since
SME_COHERENT only support cache invalidation at CPU side. All confidential
cache lines are still incoherent with DMA devices.
