Subject: ARM: dts: Use level interrupt for omap4 & 5 wlcore

From: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>

[ Upstream commit 087a2b7ec973f6f30f6e7b72cb50b6f7734ffdd2 ]

Commit 572cf7d7b07d ("ARM: dts: Improve omap l4per idling with wlcore edge
sensitive interrupt") changed wlcore interrupts to use edge interrupt based
on what's specified in the wl1835mod.pdf data sheet.

However, there are still cases where we can have lost interrupts as
described in omap_gpio_unidle(). And using a level interrupt instead of edge
interrupt helps as we avoid the check for untriggered GPIO interrupts in
omap_gpio_unidle().

And with commit e6818d29ea15 ("gpio: gpio-omap: configure edge detection
for level IRQs for idle wakeup") GPIOs idle just fine with level interrupts.

Let's change omap4 and 5 wlcore users back to using level interrupt
instead of edge interrupt. Let's not change the others as I've only seen
this on omap4 and 5, probably because the other SoCs don't have l4per idle
independent of the CPUs.
