Subject: ARM: 8990/1: use VFP assembler mnemonics in register load/store
 macros

From: Stefan Agner <stefan@agner.ch>

commit ee440336e5ef977c397afdb72cbf9c6b8effc8ea upstream.

The integrated assembler of Clang 10 and earlier do not allow to access
the VFP registers through the coprocessor load/store instructions:
<instantiation>:4:6: error: invalid operand for instruction
 LDC p11, cr0, [r10],#32*4 @ FLDMIAD r10!, {d0-d15}
     ^

This has been addressed with Clang 11 [0]. However, to support earlier
versions of Clang and for better readability use of VFP assembler
mnemonics still is preferred.

Replace the coprocessor load/store instructions with explicit assembler
mnemonics to accessing the floating point coprocessor registers. Use
assembler directives to select the appropriate FPU version.

This allows to build these macros with GNU assembler as well as with
Clang's built-in assembler.
