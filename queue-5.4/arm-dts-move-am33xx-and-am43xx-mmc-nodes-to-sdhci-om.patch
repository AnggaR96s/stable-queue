Subject: ARM: dts: Move am33xx and am43xx mmc nodes to sdhci-omap driver

From: Faiz Abbas <faiz_abbas@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit 0b4edf111870b83ea77b1d7e16b8ceac29f9f388 ]

Move mmc nodes to be compatible with the sdhci-omap driver. The following
modifications are required for omap_hsmmc specific properties:

ti,non-removable: convert to the generic mmc non-removable
ti,needs-special-reset:  co-opted into the sdhci-omap driver
ti,dual-volt: removed. Legacy property not used in am335x or am43xx
ti,needs-special-hs-handling: removed. Legacy property not used in am335x
or am43xx

Also since the sdhci-omap driver does not support runtime PM, explicitly
disable the mmc3 instance in the dtsi.
