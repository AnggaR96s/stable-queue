Subject: ARM: dts: vfxxx: Correctly use two tuples for timer address

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit f3440dcf8b994197c968fbafe047ce27eed226e8 ]

Address and size-cells are 1 and the ftm timer node takes two address
spaces in "reg" property, so this should be in two <> tuples.  Change
has no functional impact, but original code is confusing/less readable.

Fixes: 07513e1330a9 ("ARM: dts: vf610: Add Freescale FlexTimer Module timer node.")
