Subject: dm raid: fix discard limits for raid1 and raid10

From: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>

commit e0910c8e4f87bb9f767e61a778b0d9271c4dc512 upstream.

Block core warned that discard_granularity was 0 for dm-raid with
personality of raid1.  Reason is that raid_io_hints() was incorrectly
special-casing raid1 rather than raid0.

But since commit 29efc390b9462 ("md/md0: optimize raid0 discard
handling") even raid0 properly handles large discards.

Fix raid_io_hints() by removing discard limits settings for raid1.
Also, fix limits for raid10 by properly stacking underlying limits as
done in blk_stack_limits().

Depends-on: 29efc390b9462 ("md/md0: optimize raid0 discard handling")
Fixes: 61697a6abd24a ("dm: eliminate 'split_discard_bios' flag from DM target interface")
