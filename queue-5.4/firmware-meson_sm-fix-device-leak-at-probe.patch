Subject: firmware: meson_sm: fix device leak at probe

From: Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>

commit 8ece3173f87df03935906d0c612c2aeda9db92ca upstream.

Make sure to drop the reference to the secure monitor device taken by
of_find_device_by_node() when looking up its driver data on behalf of
other drivers (e.g. during probe).

Note that holding a reference to the platform device does not prevent
its driver data from going away so there is no point in keeping the
reference after the helper returns.

Fixes: 8cde3c2153e8 ("firmware: meson_sm: Rework driver as a proper platform driver")
