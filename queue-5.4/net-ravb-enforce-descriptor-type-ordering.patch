[ Upstream commit 5370c31e84b0e0999c7b5ff949f4e104def35584 ]

Ensure the TX descriptor type fields are published in a safe order so the
DMA engine never begins processing a descriptor chain before all descriptor
fields are fully initialised.

For multi-descriptor transmits the driver writes DT_FEND into the last
descriptor and DT_FSTART into the first. The DMA engine begins processing
when it observes DT_FSTART. Move the dma_wmb() barrier so it executes
immediately after DT_FEND and immediately before writing DT_FSTART
(and before DT_FSINGLE in the single-descriptor case). This guarantees
that all prior CPU writes to the descriptor memory are visible to the
device before DT_FSTART is seen.

This avoids a situation where compiler/CPU reordering could publish
DT_FSTART ahead of DT_FEND or other descriptor fields, allowing the DMA to
start on a partially initialised chain and causing corrupted transmissions
or TX timeouts. Such a failure was observed on RZ/G2L with an RT kernel as
transmit queue timeouts and device resets.
