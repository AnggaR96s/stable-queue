[ Upstream commit 2153bd1e3d3dbf6a3403572084ef6ed31c53c5f0 ]

The SMC fallback is incomplete currently. There may be some
wait queue entries remaining in smc socket->wq, which should
be removed to clcsocket->wq during the fallback.

For example, in nginx/wrk benchmark, this issue causes an
all-zeros test result:

server: nginx -g 'daemon off;'
client: smc_run wrk -c 1 -t 1 -d 5 http://11.200.15.93/index.html

  Running 5s test @ http://11.200.15.93/index.html
     1 threads and 1 connections
     Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   ± Stdev
     	Latency     0.00us    0.00us   0.00us    -nan%
	Req/Sec     0.00      0.00     0.00      -nan%
	0 requests in 5.00s, 0.00B read
     Requests/sec:      0.00
     Transfer/sec:       0.00B

The reason for this all-zeros result is that when wrk used SMC
to replace TCP, it added an eppoll_entry into smc socket->wq
and expected to be notified if epoll events like EPOLL_IN/
EPOLL_OUT occurred on the smc socket.

However, once a fallback occurred, wrk switches to use clcsocket.
Now it is clcsocket->wq instead of smc socket->wq which will
be woken up. The eppoll_entry remaining in smc socket->wq does
not work anymore and wrk stops the test.

This patch fixes this issue by removing remaining wait queue
entries from smc socket->wq to clcsocket->wq during the fallback.
