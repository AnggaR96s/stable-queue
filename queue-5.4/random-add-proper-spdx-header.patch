Subject: random: add proper SPDX header

From: "Jason A. Donenfeld" <Jason@zx2c4.com>

commit a07fdae346c35c6ba286af1c88e0effcfa330bf9 upstream.

Convert the current license into the SPDX notation of "(GPL-2.0 OR
BSD-3-Clause)". This infers GPL-2.0 from the text "ALTERNATIVELY, this
product may be distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License, in which case the provisions of the GPL are required INSTEAD OF
the above restrictions" and it infers BSD-3-Clause from the verbatim
BSD 3 clause license in the file.
