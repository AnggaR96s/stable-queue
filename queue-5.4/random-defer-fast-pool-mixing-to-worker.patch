Subject: random: defer fast pool mixing to worker

From: "Jason A. Donenfeld" <Jason@zx2c4.com>

commit 58340f8e952b613e0ead0bed58b97b05bf4743c5 upstream.

On PREEMPT_RT, it's problematic to take spinlocks from hard irq
handlers. We can fix this by deferring to a workqueue the dumping of
the fast pool into the input pool.

We accomplish this with some careful rules on fast_pool->count:

  - When it's incremented to >= 64, we schedule the work.
  - If the top bit is set, we never schedule the work, even if >= 64.
  - The worker is responsible for setting it back to 0 when it's done.

There are two small issues around using workqueues for this purpose that
we work around.

The first issue is that mix_interrupt_randomness() might be migrated to
another CPU during CPU hotplug. This issue is rectified by checking that
it hasn't been migrated (after disabling irqs). If it has been migrated,
then we set the count to zero, so that when the CPU comes online again,
it can requeue the work. As part of this, we switch to using an
atomic_t, so that the increment in the irq handler doesn't wipe out the
zeroing if the CPU comes back online while this worker is running.

The second issue is that, though relatively minor in effect, we probably
want to make sure we get a consistent view of the pool onto the stack,
in case it's interrupted by an irq while reading. To do this, we don't
reenable irqs until after the copy. There are only 18 instructions
between the cli and sti, so this is a pretty tiny window.
