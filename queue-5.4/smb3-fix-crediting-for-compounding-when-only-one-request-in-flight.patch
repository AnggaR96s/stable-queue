Subject: smb3: fix crediting for compounding when only one request in flight

From: Pavel Shilovsky <pshilov@microsoft.com>

commit 91792bb8089b63b7b780251eb83939348ac58a64 upstream.

Currently we try to guess if a compound request is going to
succeed waiting for credits or not based on the number of
requests in flight. This approach doesn't work correctly
all the time because there may be only one request in
flight which is going to bring multiple credits satisfying
the compound request.

Change the behavior to fail a request only if there are no requests
in flight at all and proceed waiting for credits otherwise.
