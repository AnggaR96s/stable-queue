Subject: Squashfs: check return result of sb_min_blocksize

From: Phillip Lougher <phillip@squashfs.org.uk>

[ Upstream commit 734aa85390ea693bb7eaf2240623d41b03705c84 ]

Syzkaller reports an "UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in squashfs_bio_read" bug.

Syzkaller forks multiple processes which after mounting the Squashfs
filesystem, issues an ioctl("/dev/loop0", LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE, 0x8000).
Now if this ioctl occurs at the same time another process is in the
process of mounting a Squashfs filesystem on /dev/loop0, the failure
occurs.  When this happens the following code in squashfs_fill_super()
fails.

----
msblk->devblksize = sb_min_blocksize(sb, SQUASHFS_DEVBLK_SIZE);
msblk->devblksize_log2 = ffz(~msblk->devblksize);
----

sb_min_blocksize() returns 0, which means msblk->devblksize is set to 0.

As a result, ffz(~msblk->devblksize) returns 64, and msblk->devblksize_log2
is set to 64.

This subsequently causes the

UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/squashfs/block.c:195:36
shift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka
'unsigned long long')

This commit adds a check for a 0 return by sb_min_blocksize().
