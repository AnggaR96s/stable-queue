Subject: tty: n_gsm: fix wrong T1 retry count handling

From: Daniel Starke <daniel.starke@siemens.com>

[ Upstream commit f30e10caa80aa1f35508bc17fc302dbbde9a833c ]

n_gsm is based on the 3GPP 07.010 and its newer version is the 3GPP 27.010.
See https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1516
The changes from 07.010 to 27.010 are non-functional. Therefore, I refer to
the newer 27.010 here. Chapter 5.7.3 states that the valid range for the
maximum number of retransmissions (N2) is from 0 to 255 (both including).
gsm_dlci_t1() handles this number incorrectly by performing N2 - 1
retransmission attempts. Setting N2 to zero results in more than 255
retransmission attempts.
Fix gsm_dlci_t1() to comply with 3GPP 27.010.
