Subject: jbd2: move the clearing of b_modified flag to the journal_unmap_buffer()

From: zhangyi (F) <yi.zhang@huawei.com>

commit 6a66a7ded12baa6ebbb2e3e82f8cb91382814839 upstream.

There is no need to delay the clearing of b_modified flag to the
transaction committing time when unmapping the journalled buffer, so
just move it to the journal_unmap_buffer().
