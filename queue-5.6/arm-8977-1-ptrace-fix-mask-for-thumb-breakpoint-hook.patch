Subject: ARM: 8977/1: ptrace: Fix mask for thumb breakpoint hook

From: Fredrik Strupe <fredrik@strupe.net>

[ Upstream commit 3866f217aaa81bf7165c7f27362eee5d7919c496 ]

call_undef_hook() in traps.c applies the same instr_mask for both 16-bit
and 32-bit thumb instructions. If instr_mask then is only 16 bits wide
(0xffff as opposed to 0xffffffff), the first half-word of 32-bit thumb
instructions will be masked out. This makes the function match 32-bit
thumb instructions where the second half-word is equal to instr_val,
regardless of the first half-word.

The result in this case is that all undefined 32-bit thumb instructions
with the second half-word equal to 0xde01 (udf #1) work as breakpoints
and will raise a SIGTRAP instead of a SIGILL, instead of just the one
intended 16-bit instruction. An example of such an instruction is
0xeaa0de01, which is unallocated according to Arm ARM and should raise a
SIGILL, but instead raises a SIGTRAP.

This patch fixes the issue by setting all the bits in instr_mask, which
will still match the intended 16-bit thumb instruction (where the
upper half is always 0), but not any 32-bit thumb instructions.
