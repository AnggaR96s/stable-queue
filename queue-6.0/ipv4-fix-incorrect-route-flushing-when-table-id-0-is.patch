Subject: ipv4: Fix incorrect route flushing when table ID 0 is used

From: Ido Schimmel <idosch@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit c0d999348e01df03e0a7f550351f3907fabbf611 ]

Cited commit added the table ID to the FIB info structure, but did not
properly initialize it when table ID 0 is used. This can lead to a route
in the default VRF with a preferred source address not being flushed
when the address is deleted.

Consider the following example:

 # ip address add dev dummy1 192.0.2.1/28
 # ip address add dev dummy1 192.0.2.17/28
 # ip route add 198.51.100.0/24 via 192.0.2.2 src 192.0.2.17 metric 100
 # ip route add table 0 198.51.100.0/24 via 192.0.2.2 src 192.0.2.17 metric 200
 # ip route show 198.51.100.0/24
 198.51.100.0/24 via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy1 src 192.0.2.17 metric 100
 198.51.100.0/24 via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy1 src 192.0.2.17 metric 200

Both routes are installed in the default VRF, but they are using two
different FIB info structures. One with a metric of 100 and table ID of
254 (main) and one with a metric of 200 and table ID of 0. Therefore,
when the preferred source address is deleted from the default VRF,
the second route is not flushed:

 # ip address del dev dummy1 192.0.2.17/28
 # ip route show 198.51.100.0/24
 198.51.100.0/24 via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy1 src 192.0.2.17 metric 200

Fix by storing a table ID of 254 instead of 0 in the route configuration
structure.

Add a test case that fails before the fix:

 # ./fib_tests.sh -t ipv4_del_addr

 IPv4 delete address route tests
     Regular FIB info
     TEST: Route removed from VRF when source address deleted            [ OK ]
     TEST: Route in default VRF not removed                              [ OK ]
     TEST: Route removed in default VRF when source address deleted      [ OK ]
     TEST: Route in VRF is not removed by address delete                 [ OK ]
     Identical FIB info with different table ID
     TEST: Route removed from VRF when source address deleted            [ OK ]
     TEST: Route in default VRF not removed                              [ OK ]
     TEST: Route removed in default VRF when source address deleted      [ OK ]
     TEST: Route in VRF is not removed by address delete                 [ OK ]
     Table ID 0
     TEST: Route removed in default VRF when source address deleted      [FAIL]

 Tests passed:   8
 Tests failed:   1

And passes after:

 # ./fib_tests.sh -t ipv4_del_addr
