Subject: KVM: VMX: Inject #PF on ENCLS as "emulated" #PF

From: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

[ Upstream commit bfcb08a0b9e99b959814a329fabace22c3df046d ]

Treat #PFs that occur during emulation of ENCLS as, wait for it, emulated
page faults.  Practically speaking, this is a glorified nop as the
exception is never of the nested flavor, and it's extremely unlikely the
guest is relying on the side effect of an implicit INVLPG on the faulting
address.
