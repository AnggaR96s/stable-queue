commit 929d8490f8790164f5f63671c1c58d6c50411cb2 upstream.

Commit b9bf5612610aa7e3 ("ARM: dts: am335x-bone-common: Increase MDIO
reset deassert time") already increased the MDIO reset deassert delay
from 6.5 to 13 ms, but this may still cause Ethernet PHY probe failures:

    SMSC LAN8710/LAN8720 4a101000.mdio:00: probe with driver SMSC LAN8710/LAN8720 failed with error -5

On BeagleBone Black Rev. C3, ETH_RESETn is controlled by an open-drain
AND gate.  It is pulled high by a 10K resistor, and has a 4.7ÂµF
capacitor to ground, giving an RC time constant of 47ms.  As it takes
0.7RC to charge the capacitor above the threshold voltage of a CMOS
input (VDD/2), the delay should be at least 33ms.  Considering the
typical tolerance of 20% on capacitors, 40ms would be safer.  Add an
additional safety margin and settle for 50ms.
