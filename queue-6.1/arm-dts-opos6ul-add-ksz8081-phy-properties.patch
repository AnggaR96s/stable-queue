[ Upstream commit 6e1a7bc8382b0d4208258f7d2a4474fae788dd90 ]

Commit c7e73b5051d6 ("ARM: imx: mach-imx6ul: remove 14x14 EVK specific
PHY fixup") removed a PHY fixup that setted the clock mode and the LED
mode.
Make the Ethernet interface work again by doing as advised in the
commit's log, set clock mode and the LED mode in the device tree.
