Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Don't enable lpass clocks by default

From: Nikita Travkin <nikita@trvn.ru>

[ Upstream commit 43926a3cb19180b4fc6cd0d72bbefc7e93592f91 ]

lpass clocks are usually blocked from HLOS by the firmware and
instead are managed by the ADSP. Mark them as reserved and explicitly
enable in the CrOS boards that have special, cooperative firmware.

The IDP board gets lpass clocks disabled as it doesn't make use of sound
anyway and might use Qualcomm firmware that blocks those clocks. [1]
