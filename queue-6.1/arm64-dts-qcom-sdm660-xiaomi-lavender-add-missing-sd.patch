Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sdm660-xiaomi-lavender: Add missing SD card detect
 GPIO

From: Alexey Minnekhanov <alexeymin@postmarketos.org>

[ Upstream commit 2eca6af66709de0d1ba14cdf8b6d200a1337a3a2 ]

During initial porting these cd-gpios were missed. Having card detect is
beneficial because driver does not need to do polling every second and it
can just use IRQ. SD card detection in U-Boot is also fixed by this.

Fixes: cf85e9aee210 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sdm660-xiaomi-lavender: Add eMMC and SD")
