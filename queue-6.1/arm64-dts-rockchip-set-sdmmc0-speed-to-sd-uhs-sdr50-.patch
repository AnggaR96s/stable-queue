Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: set sdmmc0 speed to sd-uhs-sdr50 on rock-3a

From: Dan Johansen <strit@manjaro.org>

[ Upstream commit bc121b707e816616567683e51fd9194c2309977a ]

As other rk336x based devices, the Rock 3 Model A has issues with high
speed SD cards, so lower the speed to 50 instead of 104 in the same
manor has the Quartz64 Model B has.
