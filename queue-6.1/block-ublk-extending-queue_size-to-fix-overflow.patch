Subject: block: ublk: extending queue_size to fix overflow

From: Liu Xiaodong <xiaodong.liu@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 29baef789c838bd5c02f50c88adbbc6b955aaf61 ]

When validating drafted SPDK ublk target, in a case that
assigning large queue depth to multiqueue ublk device,
ublk target would run into a weird incorrect state. During
rounds of review and debug, An overflow bug was found
in ublk driver.

In ublk_cmd.h, UBLK_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH is 4096 which means
each ublk queue depth can be set as large as 4096. But
when setting qd for a ublk device,
sizeof(struct ublk_queue) + depth * sizeof(struct ublk_io)
will be larger than 65535 if qd is larger than 2728.
Then queue_size is overflowed, and ublk_get_queue()
references a wrong pointer position. The wrong content of
ublk_queue elements will lead to out-of-bounds memory
access.

Extend queue_size in ublk_device as "unsigned int".
