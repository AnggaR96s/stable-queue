Subject: fbcon: Fix outdated registered_fb reference in comment

From: Shixiong Ou <oushixiong@kylinos.cn>

[ Upstream commit 0f168e7be696a17487e83d1d47e5a408a181080f ]

The variable was renamed to fbcon_registered_fb, but this comment was
not updated along with the change. Correct it to avoid confusion.
