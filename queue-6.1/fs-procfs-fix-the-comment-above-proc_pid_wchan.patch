Subject: fs/procfs: fix the comment above proc_pid_wchan()

From: Bart Van Assche <bvanassche@acm.org>

[ Upstream commit 6287fbad1cd91f0c25cdc3a580499060828a8f30 ]

proc_pid_wchan() used to report kernel addresses to user space but that is
no longer the case today.  Bring the comment above proc_pid_wchan() in
sync with the implementation.

Fixes: b2f73922d119 ("fs/proc, core/debug: Don't expose absolute kernel addresses via wchan")
