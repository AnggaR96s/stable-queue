Subject: HID: magicmouse: Do not crash on missing msc->input
MIME-Version: 1.0

From: Günther Noack <gnoack@google.com>

[ Upstream commit 17abd396548035fbd6179ee1a431bd75d49676a7 ]

Fake USB devices can send their own report descriptors for which the
input_mapping() hook does not get called.  In this case, msc->input stays NULL,
leading to a crash at a later time.

Detect this condition in the input_configured() hook and reject the device.

This is not supposed to happen with actual magic mouse devices, but can be
provoked by imposing as a magic mouse USB device.
