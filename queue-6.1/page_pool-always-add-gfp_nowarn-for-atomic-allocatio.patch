Subject: page_pool: always add GFP_NOWARN for ATOMIC allocations

From: Jakub Kicinski <kuba@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit f3b52167a0cb23b27414452fbc1278da2ee884fc ]

Driver authors often forget to add GFP_NOWARN for page allocation
from the datapath. This is annoying to users as OOMs are a fact
of life, and we pretty much expect network Rx to hit page allocation
failures during OOM. Make page pool add GFP_NOWARN for ATOMIC allocations
by default.
