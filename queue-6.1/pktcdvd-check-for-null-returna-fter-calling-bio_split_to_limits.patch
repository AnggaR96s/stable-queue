Subject: pktcdvd: check for NULL returna fter calling bio_split_to_limits()

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>

commit 3e9900f3bd7ba30d60f82b162b70a1dffe4e8e24 upstream.

The revert of the removal of this driver happened after we fixed up
the split limits for NOWAIT issue, hence it got missed. Ensure that
we check for a NULL bio after splitting, in case it should be retried.

Marking this as fixing both commits, so that stable backport will do
this correctly.
