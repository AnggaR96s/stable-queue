Subject: platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: add missing Ideapad Pro 5 fn keys

From: Renato Caldas <renato@calgera.com>

commit 36e66be874a7ea9d28fb9757629899a8449b8748 upstream.

The scancodes for the Mic Mute and Airplane keys on the Ideapad Pro 5
(14AHP9 at least, probably the other variants too) are different and
were not being picked up by the driver. This adds them to the keymap.

Apart from what is already supported, the remaining fn keys are
unfortunately producing windows-specific key-combos.
