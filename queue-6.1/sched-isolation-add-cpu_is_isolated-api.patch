Subject: sched/isolation: add cpu_is_isolated() API

From: Frederic Weisbecker <frederic@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit a85c2257a8ac353af16dbcbf32c50d3380860bc5 ]

Patch series "memcg, cpuisol: do not interfere pcp cache charges draining
with cpuisol workloads".

Leonardo has reported [1] that pcp memcg charge draining can interfere
with cpu isolated workloads.  The said draining is done from a WQ context
with a pcp worker scheduled on each CPU which holds any cached charges for
a specific memcg hierarchy.  Operation is not really a common operation
[2].  It can be triggered from the userspace though so some care is
definitely due.

Leonardo has tried to address the issue by allowing remote charge draining
[3].  This approach requires an additional locking to synchronize pcp
caches sync from a remote cpu from local pcp consumers.  Even though the
proposed lock was per-cpu there is still potential for contention and less
predictable behavior.

This patchset addresses the issue from a different angle.  Rather than
dealing with a potential synchronization, cpus which are isolated are
simply never scheduled to be drained.  This means that a small amount of
charges could be laying around and waiting for a later use or they are
flushed when a different memcg is charged from the same cpu.  More details
are in patch 2.  The first patch from Frederic is implementing an
abstraction to tell whether a specific cpu has been isolated and therefore
require a special treatment.

This patch (of 2):

Provide this new API to check if a CPU has been isolated either through
isolcpus= or nohz_full= kernel parameter.

It aims at avoiding kernel load deemed to be safely spared on CPUs running
sensitive workload that can't bear any disturbance, such as pcp cache
draining.
