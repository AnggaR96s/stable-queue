Subject: sctp: do not check hb_timer.expires when resetting hb_timer

From: Xin Long <lucien.xin@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 8f35ae17ef565a605de5f409e04bcd49a55d7646 ]

It tries to avoid the frequently hb_timer refresh in commit ba6f5e33bdbb
("sctp: avoid refreshing heartbeat timer too often"), and it only allows
mod_timer when the new expires is after hb_timer.expires. It means even
a much shorter interval for hb timer gets applied, it will have to wait
until the current hb timer to time out.

In sctp_do_8_2_transport_strike(), when a transport enters PF state, it
expects to update the hb timer to resend a heartbeat every rto after
calling sctp_transport_reset_hb_timer(), which will not work as the
change mentioned above.

The frequently hb_timer refresh was caused by sctp_transport_reset_timers()
called in sctp_outq_flush() and it was already removed in the commit above.
So we don't have to check hb_timer.expires when resetting hb_timer as it is
now not called very often.
