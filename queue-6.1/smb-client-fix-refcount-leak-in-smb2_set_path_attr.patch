Subject: smb: client: fix refcount leak in smb2_set_path_attr

From: Shuhao Fu <sfual@cse.ust.hk>

[ Upstream commit b540de9e3b4fab3b9e10f30714a6f5c1b2a50ec3 ]

Fix refcount leak in `smb2_set_path_attr` when path conversion fails.

Function `cifs_get_writable_path` returns `cfile` with its reference
counter `cfile->count` increased on success. Function `smb2_compound_op`
would decrease the reference counter for `cfile`, as stated in its
comment. By calling `smb2_rename_path`, the reference counter of `cfile`
would leak if `cifs_convert_path_to_utf16` fails in `smb2_set_path_attr`.

Fixes: 8de9e86c67ba ("cifs: create a helper to find a writeable handle by path name")
