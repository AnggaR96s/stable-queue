Subject: tls: wait for async encrypt in case of error during latter iterations
 of sendmsg

From: Sabrina Dubroca <sd@queasysnail.net>

[ Upstream commit b014a4e066c555185b7c367efacdc33f16695495 ]

If we hit an error during the main loop of tls_sw_sendmsg_locked (eg
failed allocation), we jump to send_end and immediately
return. Previous iterations may have queued async encryption requests
that are still pending. We should wait for those before returning, as
we could otherwise be reading from memory that userspace believes
we're not using anymore, which would be a sort of use-after-free.

This is similar to what tls_sw_recvmsg already does: failures during
the main loop jump to the "wait for async" code, not straight to the
unlock/return.

Fixes: a42055e8d2c3 ("net/tls: Add support for async encryption of records for performance")
