Subject: tracing: Fix trace_event_raw_event_synth() if else statement

From: Steven Rostedt (Google) <rostedt@goodmis.org>

commit 9971c3f944489ff7aacb9d25e0cde841a5f6018a upstream.

The test to check if the field is a stack is to be done if it is not a
string. But the code had:

    } if (event->fields[i]->is_stack) {

and not

   } else if (event->fields[i]->is_stack) {

which would cause it to always be tested. Worse yet, this also included an
"else" statement that was only to be called if the field was not a string
and a stack, but this code allows it to be called if it was a string (and
not a stack).

Also fixed some whitespace issues.
