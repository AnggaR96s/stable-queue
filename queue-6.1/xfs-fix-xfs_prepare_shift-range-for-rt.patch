Subject: xfs: Fix xfs_prepare_shift() range for RT

From: John Garry <john.g.garry@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit f23660f059470ec7043748da7641e84183c23bc8 ]

The RT extent range must be considered in the xfs_flush_unmap_range() call
to stabilize the boundary.

This code change is originally from Dave Chinner.
