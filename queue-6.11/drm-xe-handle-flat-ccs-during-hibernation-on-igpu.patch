Subject: drm/xe: handle flat ccs during hibernation on igpu

From: Matthew Auld <matthew.auld@intel.com>

commit be7eeaba2a11d7c16a9dc034a25f224f1343f303 upstream.

Starting from LNL, CCS has moved over to flat CCS model where there is
now dedicated memory reserved for storing compression state. On
platforms like LNL this reserved memory lives inside graphics stolen
memory, which is not treated like normal RAM and is therefore skipped by
the core kernel when creating the hibernation image. Currently if
something was compressed and we enter hibernation all the corresponding
CCS state is lost on such HW, resulting in corrupted memory. To fix this
evict user buffers from TT -> SYSTEM to ensure we take a snapshot of the
raw CCS state when entering hibernation, where upon resuming we can
restore the raw CCS state back when next validating the buffer. This has
been confirmed to fix display corruption on LNL when coming back from
hibernation.
