Subject: arm64: Add support for TSV110 Spectre-BHB mitigation

From: Jinqian Yang <yangjinqian1@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit e3baa5d4b361276efeb87b20d8beced451a7dbd5 ]

The TSV110 processor is vulnerable to the Spectre-BHB (Branch History
Buffer) attack, which can be exploited to leak information through
branch prediction side channels. This commit adds the MIDR of TSV110
to the list for software mitigation.
