Subject: arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8395-genio-1200-evk: Drop
 regulator-compatible property

From: Chen-Yu Tsai <wenst@chromium.org>

[ Upstream commit b99bf07c2c8b3c85c1935ddca2a73bc686f8d847 ]

The "regulator-compatible" property has been deprecated since 2012 in
commit 13511def87b9 ("regulator: deprecate regulator-compatible DT
property"), which is so old it's not even mentioned in the converted
regulator bindings YAML file. It should not have been used for new
submissions such as the MT6315.

Drop the "regulator-compatible" property from the board dts. The
property values are the same as the node name, so everything should
continue to work.

Fixes: f2b543a191b6 ("arm64: dts: mediatek: add device-tree for Genio 1200 EVK board")
