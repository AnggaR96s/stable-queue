Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: msm8939: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 5c775f586cde4fca3c5591c43b6dc8b243bc304c ]

The MSM8939 platform uses PM8916 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
