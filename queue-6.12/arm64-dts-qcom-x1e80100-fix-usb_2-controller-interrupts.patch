Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Fix usb_2 controller interrupts

From: Abel Vesa <abel.vesa@linaro.org>

commit 680421056216efe727ff4ed48f481691d5873b9e upstream.

Back when the CRD support was brought up, the usb_2 controller didn't
have anything connected to it in order to test it properly, so it was
never enabled.

On the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s, the usb_2 controller has the fingerprint
controller connected to it. So enabling it, proved that the interrupts
lines were wrong from the start.

Fix both the pwr_event and the DWC ctrl_irq lines, according to
documentation.
