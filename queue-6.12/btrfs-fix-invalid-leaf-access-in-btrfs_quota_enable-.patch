Subject: btrfs: fix invalid leaf access in btrfs_quota_enable() if ref key not
 found

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

[ Upstream commit ecb7c2484cfc83a93658907580035a8adf1e0a92 ]

If btrfs_search_slot_for_read() returns 1, it means we did not find any
key greater than or equals to the key we asked for, meaning we have
reached the end of the tree and therefore the path is not valid. If
this happens we need to break out of the loop and stop, instead of
continuing and accessing an invalid path.

Fixes: 5223cc60b40a ("btrfs: drop the path before adding qgroup items when enabling qgroups")
