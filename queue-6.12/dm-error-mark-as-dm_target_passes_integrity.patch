Subject: dm error: mark as DM_TARGET_PASSES_INTEGRITY

From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

[ Upstream commit 499cbe0f2fb0641cf07a1a8ac9f7317674295fea ]

Mark dm error as DM_TARGET_PASSES_INTEGRITY so that it can be stacked on
top of PI capable devices.  The claim is strictly speaking as lie as dm
error fails all I/O and doesn't pass anything on, but doing the same for
integrity I/O work just fine :)

This helps to make about two dozen xfstests test cases pass on PI capable
devices.
