Subject: dt-bindings: PCI: qcom,pcie-sc7280: Add missing required power-domains and resets

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>

commit ef99c2efeacac7758cc8c2d00e3200100a4da16c upstream.

Commit 756485bfbb85 ("dt-bindings: PCI: qcom,pcie-sc7280: Move SC7280 to
dedicated schema") move the device schema to separate file, but it
missed a "if:not:...then:" clause in the original binding which was
requiring power-domains and resets for this particular chip.

Fixes: 756485bfbb85 ("dt-bindings: PCI: qcom,pcie-sc7280: Move SC7280 to dedicated schema")
