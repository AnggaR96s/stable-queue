Subject: HID: multitouch: specify that Apple Touch Bar is direct

From: Kerem Karabay <kekrby@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 45ca23c5ee8b2b3074377fecc92fa72aa595f7c9 ]

Currently the driver determines the device type based on the
application, but this value is not reliable on Apple Touch Bar, where
the application is HID_DG_TOUCHPAD even though this device is direct,
so add a quirk for the same.
