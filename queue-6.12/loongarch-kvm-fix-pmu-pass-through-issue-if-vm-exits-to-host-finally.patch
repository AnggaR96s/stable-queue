Subject: LoongArch: KVM: Fix PMU pass-through issue if VM exits to host finally

From: Bibo Mao <maobibo@loongson.cn>

commit 5add0dbbebd60628b55e5eb8426612dedab7311a upstream.

In function kvm_pre_enter_guest(), it prepares to enter guest and check
whether there are pending signals or events. And it will not enter guest
if there are, PMU pass-through preparation for guest should be cancelled
and host should own PMU hardware.
