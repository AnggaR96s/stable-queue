Subject: mctp i2c: initialise event handler read bytes

From: Matt Johnston <matt@codeconstruct.com.au>

[ Upstream commit 2a14e91b6d76639dac70ea170f4384c1ee3cb48d ]

Set a 0xff value for i2c reads of an mctp-i2c device. Otherwise reads
will return "val" from the i2c bus driver. For i2c-aspeed and
i2c-npcm7xx that is a stack uninitialised u8.

Tested with "i2ctransfer -y 1 r10@0x34" where 0x34 is a mctp-i2c
instance, now it returns all 0xff.
