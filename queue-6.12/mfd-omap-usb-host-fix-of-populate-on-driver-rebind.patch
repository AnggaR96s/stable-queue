Subject: mfd: omap-usb-host: Fix OF populate on driver rebind

From: Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 24804ba508a3e240501c521685a1c4eb9f574f8e ]

Since commit c6e126de43e7 ("of: Keep track of populated platform
devices") child devices will not be created by of_platform_populate()
if the devices had previously been deregistered individually so that the
OF_POPULATED flag is still set in the corresponding OF nodes.

Switch to using of_platform_depopulate() instead of open coding so that
the child devices are created if the driver is rebound.

Fixes: c6e126de43e7 ("of: Keep track of populated platform devices")
