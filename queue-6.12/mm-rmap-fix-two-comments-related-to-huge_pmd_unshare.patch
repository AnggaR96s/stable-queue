Subject: mm/rmap: fix two comments related to huge_pmd_unshare()

From: David Hildenbrand (Red Hat) <david@kernel.org>

commit a8682d500f691b6dfaa16ae1502d990aeb86e8be upstream.

PMD page table unsharing no longer touches the refcount of a PMD page
table.  Also, it is not about dropping the refcount of a "PMD page" but
the "PMD page table".

Let's just simplify by saying that the PMD page table was unmapped,
consequently also unmapping the folio that was mapped into this page.

This code should be deduplicated in the future.
