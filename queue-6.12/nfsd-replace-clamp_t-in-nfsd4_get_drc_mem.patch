Subject: nfsd: Replace clamp_t in nfsd4_get_drc_mem()
Message-ID: <20251114211922.6312-1-cel@kernel.org>

From: NeilBrown <neil@brown.name>

A recent change to clamp_t() in 6.1.y caused fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c to fail
to compile with gcc-9. The code in nfsd4_get_drc_mem() was written with
the assumption that when "max < min",

   clamp(val, min, max)

would return max.  This assumption is not documented as an API promise
and the change caused a compile failure if it could be statically
determined that "max < min".

The relevant code was no longer present upstream when commit 1519fbc8832b
("minmax.h: use BUILD_BUG_ON_MSG() for the lo < hi test in clamp()")
landed there, so there is no upstream change to nfsd4_get_drc_mem() to
backport.

There is no clear case that the existing code in nfsd4_get_drc_mem()
is functioning incorrectly. The goal of this patch is to permit the clean
application of commit 1519fbc8832b ("minmax.h: use BUILD_BUG_ON_MSG() for
the lo < hi test in clamp()"), and any commits that depend on it, to LTS
kernels without affecting the ability to compile those kernels. This is
done by open-coding the __clamp() macro sans the built-in type checking.

Changes since Neil's post:
* Editorial changes to the commit message
* Attempt to address David's review comments
* Applied to linux-6.12.y, passed NFSD upstream CI suite

This patch is intended to be applied to linux-6.12.y, and should
apply cleanly to other LTS kernels since nfsd4_get_drc_mem hasn't
changed since v5.4.
