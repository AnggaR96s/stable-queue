Subject: nvme-fc: go straight to connecting state when initializing

From: Daniel Wagner <wagi@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit d3d380eded7ee5fc2fc53b3b0e72365ded025c4a ]

The initial controller initialization mimiks the reconnect loop
behavior by switching from NEW to RESETTING and then to CONNECTING.

The transition from NEW to CONNECTING is a valid transition, so there is
no point entering the RESETTING state. TCP and RDMA also transition
directly to CONNECTING state.
