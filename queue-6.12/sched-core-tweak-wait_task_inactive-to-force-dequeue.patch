Subject: sched/core: Tweak wait_task_inactive() to force dequeue sched_delayed
 tasks

From: John Stultz <jstultz@google.com>

[ Upstream commit b7ca5743a2604156d6083b88cefacef983f3a3a6 ]

It was reported that in 6.12, smpboot_create_threads() was
taking much longer then in 6.6.

I narrowed down the call path to:
 smpboot_create_threads()
 -> kthread_create_on_cpu()
    -> kthread_bind()
       -> __kthread_bind_mask()
          ->wait_task_inactive()

Where in wait_task_inactive() we were regularly hitting the
queued case, which sets a 1 tick timeout, which when called
multiple times in a row, accumulates quickly into a long
delay.

I noticed disabling the DELAY_DEQUEUE sched feature recovered
the performance, and it seems the newly create tasks are usually
sched_delayed and left on the runqueue.

So in wait_task_inactive() when we see the task
p->se.sched_delayed, manually dequeue the sched_delayed task
with DEQUEUE_DELAYED, so we don't have to constantly wait a
tick.
