Subject: tracing: Fix checking of freed trace_event_file for hist files

From: Petr Pavlu <petr.pavlu@suse.com>

[ Upstream commit f0a0da1f907e8488826d91c465f7967a56a95aca ]

The event_hist_open() and event_hist_poll() functions currently retrieve
a trace_event_file pointer from a file struct by invoking
event_file_data(), which simply returns file->f_inode->i_private. The
functions then check if the pointer is NULL to determine whether the event
is still valid. This approach is flawed because i_private is assigned when
an eventfs inode is allocated and remains set throughout its lifetime.
Instead, the code should call event_file_file(), which checks for
EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED. Using the incorrect access function may result in the
code potentially opening a hist file for an event that is being removed or
becoming stuck while polling on this file.

Correct the access method to event_file_file() in both functions.
