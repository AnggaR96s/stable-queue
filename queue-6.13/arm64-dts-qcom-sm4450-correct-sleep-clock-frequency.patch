Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm4450: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 158e67cf3619dbb5b9914bb364889041f4b90eea ]

The SM4450 platform uses PM4450 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
