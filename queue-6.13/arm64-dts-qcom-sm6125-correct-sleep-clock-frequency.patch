Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm6125: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit b3c547e1507862f0e4d46432b665c5c6e61e14d6 ]

The SM6125 platform uses PM6125 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
