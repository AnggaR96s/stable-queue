Subject: drm/msm/dp: dont call dp_catalog_ctrl_mainlink_ctrl in
 dp_ctrl_configure_source_params()

From: Abhinav Kumar <quic_abhinavk@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 50e608d166ba68faacf81a5ce17c09b0c697eefd ]

Once the link has already been setup there is no need to call
dp_catalog_ctrl_mainlink_ctrl() as this does a reset on the mainlink
thereby tearing down the link briefly.
