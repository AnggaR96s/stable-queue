Subject: iio: hid-sensor-prox: Split difference from multiple channels

From: Ricardo Ribalda <ribalda@chromium.org>

[ Upstream commit 4eba4d92906c3814ca3ec65c16af27c46c12342e ]

When the driver was originally created, it was decided that
sampling_frequency and hysteresis would be shared_per_type instead
of shared_by_all (even though it is internally shared by all). Eg:
in_proximity_raw
in_proximity_sampling_frequency

When we introduced support for more channels, we continued with
shared_by_type which. Eg:
in_proximity0_raw
in_proximity1_raw
in_proximity_sampling_frequency
in_attention_raw
in_attention_sampling_frequency

Ideally we should change to shared_by_all, but it is not an option,
because the current naming has been a stablished ABI by now. Luckily we
can use separate instead. That will be more consistent:
in_proximity0_raw
in_proximity0_sampling_frequency
in_proximity1_raw
in_proximity1_sampling_frequency
in_attention_raw
in_attention_sampling_frequency
