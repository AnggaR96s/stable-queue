Subject: sched/deadline: Check bandwidth overflow earlier for hotplug

From: Juri Lelli <juri.lelli@redhat.com>

commit 53916d5fd3c0b658de3463439dd2b7ce765072cb upstream.

Currently we check for bandwidth overflow potentially due to hotplug
operations at the end of sched_cpu_deactivate(), after the cpu going
offline has already been removed from scheduling, active_mask, etc.
This can create issues for DEADLINE tasks, as there is a substantial
race window between the start of sched_cpu_deactivate() and the moment
we possibly decide to roll-back the operation if dl_bw_deactivate()
returns failure in cpuset_cpu_inactive(). An example is a throttled
task that sees its replenishment timer firing while the cpu it was
previously running on is considered offline, but before
dl_bw_deactivate() had a chance to say no and roll-back happened.

Fix this by directly calling dl_bw_deactivate() first thing in
sched_cpu_deactivate() and do the required calculation in the former
function considering the cpu passed as an argument as offline already.

By doing so we also simplify sched_cpu_deactivate(), as there is no need
anymore for any kind of roll-back if we fail early.
