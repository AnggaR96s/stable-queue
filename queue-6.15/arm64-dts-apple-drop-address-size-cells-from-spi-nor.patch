Subject: arm64: dts: apple: Drop {address,size}-cells from SPI NOR

From: Sven Peter <sven@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 811a909978bf59caa25359e0aca4e30500dcff26 ]

Fix the following warning by dropping #{address,size}-cells from the SPI
NOR node which only has a single child node without reg property:

spi1-nvram.dtsi:19.10-38.4: Warning (avoid_unnecessary_addr_size): /soc/spi@235104000/flash@0: unnecessary #address-cells/#size-cells without "ranges", "dma-ranges" or child "reg" property

Fixes: 3febe9de5ca5 ("arm64: dts: apple: Add SPI NOR nvram partition to all devices")
