Subject: md: call del_gendisk in control path

From: Xiao Ni <xni@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 9e59d609763f70a992a8f3808dabcce60f14eb5c ]

Now del_gendisk and put_disk are called asynchronously in workqueue work.
The asynchronous way has a problem that the device node can still exist
after mdadm --stop command returns in a short window. So udev rule can
open this device node and create the struct mddev in kernel again. So put
del_gendisk in control path and still leave put_disk in md_kobj_release
to avoid uaf of gendisk.

Function del_gendisk can't be called with reconfig_mutex. If it's called
with reconfig mutex, a deadlock can happen. del_gendisk waits all sysfs
files access to finish and sysfs file access waits reconfig mutex. So
put del_gendisk after releasing reconfig mutex.

But there is still a window that sysfs can be accessed between mddev_unlock
and del_gendisk. So some actions (add disk, change level, .e.g) can happen
which lead unexpected results. MD_DELETED is used to resolve this problem.
MD_DELETED is set before releasing reconfig mutex and it should be checked
for these sysfs access which need reconfig mutex. For sysfs access which
don't need reconfig mutex, del_gendisk will wait them to finish.

But it doesn't need to do this in function mddev_lock_nointr. There are
ten places that call it.
* Five of them are in dm raid which we don't need to care. MD_DELETED is
only used for md raid.
* stop_sync_thread, md_do_sync and md_start_sync are related sync request,
and it needs to wait sync thread to finish before stopping an array.
* md_ioctl: md_open is called before md_ioctl, so ->openers is added. It
will fail to stop the array. So it doesn't need to check MD_DELETED here
* md_set_readonly:
It needs to call mddev_set_closing_and_sync_blockdev when setting readonly
or read_auto. So it will fail to stop the array too because MD_CLOSING is
already set.
