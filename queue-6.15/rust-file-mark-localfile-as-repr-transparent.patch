Subject: rust: file: mark `LocalFile` as `repr(transparent)`

From: Pekka Ristola <pekkarr@protonmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 15ecd83dc06277385ad71dc7ea26911d9a79acaf ]

Unsafe code in `LocalFile`'s methods assumes that the type has the same
layout as the inner `bindings::file`. This is not guaranteed by the default
struct representation in Rust, but requires specifying the `transparent`
representation.

The `File` struct (which also wraps `bindings::file`) is already marked as
`repr(transparent)`, so this change makes their layouts equivalent.

Fixes: 851849824bb5 ("rust: file: add Rust abstraction for `struct file`")
Closes: https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/issues/1165
