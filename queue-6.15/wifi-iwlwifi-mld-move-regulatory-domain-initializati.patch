Subject: wifi: iwlwifi: mld: Move regulatory domain initialization

From: Ilan Peer <ilan.peer@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit f81aa834bfa91c827f290b62a245e23c5ad2813c ]

The regulatory domain information was initialized every time the
FW was loaded and the device was restarted. This was unnecessary
and useless as at this stage the wiphy channels information was
not setup yet so while the regulatory domain was set to the wiphy,
the channel information was not updated.

In case that a specific MCC was configured during FW initialization
then following updates with this MCC are ignored, and thus the
wiphy channels information is left with information not matching
the regulatory domain.

This commit moves the regulatory domain initialization to after the
operational firmware is started, i.e., after the wiphy channels were
configured and the regulatory information is needed.
