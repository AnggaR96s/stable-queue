Subject: HID: multitouch: support getting the tip state from HID_DG_TOUCH
 fields in Apple Touch Bar

From: Kerem Karabay <kekrby@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit e0976a61a543b5e03bc0d08030a0ea036ee3751d ]

In Apple Touch Bar, the tip state is contained in fields with the
HID_DG_TOUCH usage. This feature is gated by a quirk in order to
prevent breaking other devices, see commit c2ef8f21ea8f
("HID: multitouch: add support for trackpads").
