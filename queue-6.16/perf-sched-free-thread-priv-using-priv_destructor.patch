Subject: perf sched: Free thread->priv using priv_destructor

From: Namhyung Kim <namhyung@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit aa9fdd106bab8c478d37eba5703c0950ad5c0d4f ]

In many perf sched subcommand saves priv data structure in the thread
but it forgot to free them.  As it's an opaque type with 'void *', it
needs to register that knows how to free the data.  In this case, just
regular 'free()' is fine.

Fixes: 04cb4fc4d40a5bf1 ("perf thread: Allow tools to register a thread->priv destructor")
