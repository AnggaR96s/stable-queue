Subject: samples/damon/prcl: avoid starting DAMON before initialization

From: SeongJae Park <sj@kernel.org>

commit e6b733ca2f99e968d696c2e812c8eb8e090bf37b upstream.

Commit 2780505ec2b4 ("samples/damon/prcl: fix boot time enable crash") is
somehow incompletely applying the origin patch [1].  It is missing the
part that avoids starting DAMON before module initialization.  Probably a
mistake during a merge has happened.  Fix it by applying the missed part
again.
