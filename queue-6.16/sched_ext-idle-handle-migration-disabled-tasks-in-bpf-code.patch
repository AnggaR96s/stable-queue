Subject: sched_ext: idle: Handle migration-disabled tasks in BPF code

From: Andrea Righi <arighi@nvidia.com>

commit 55ed11b181c43d81ce03b50209e4e7c4a14ba099 upstream.

When scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl()/and() kfuncs are invoked outside of
ops.select_cpu() we can't rely on @p->migration_disabled to determine if
migration is disabled for the task @p.

In fact, migration is always disabled for the current task while running
BPF code: __bpf_prog_enter() disables migration and __bpf_prog_exit()
re-enables it.

To handle this, when @p->migration_disabled == 1, check whether @p is
the current task. If so, migration was not disabled before entering the
callback, otherwise migration was disabled.

This ensures correct idle CPU selection in all cases. The behavior of
ops.select_cpu() remains unchanged, because this callback is never
invoked for the current task and migration-disabled tasks are always
excluded.

Example: without this change scx_bpf_select_cpu_and() called from
ops.enqueue() always returns -EBUSY; with this change applied, it
correctly returns idle CPUs.
