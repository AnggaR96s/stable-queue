Subject: ARM: dts: renesas: gose: Remove superfluous port property

From: Wolfram Sang <wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>

[ Upstream commit 00df14f34615630f92f97c9d6790bd9d25c4242d ]

'bus-width' is defined for the corresponding vin input port already.
No need to declare it in the output port again. Fixes:

    arch/arm/boot/dts/renesas/r8a7793-gose.dtb: composite-in@20 (adi,adv7180cp): ports:port@3:endpoint: Unevaluated properties are not allowed ('bus-width' was unexpected)
    from schema $id: http://devicetree.org/schemas/media/i2c/adi,adv7180.yaml#
