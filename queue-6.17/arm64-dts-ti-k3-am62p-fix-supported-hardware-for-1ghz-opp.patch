Subject: arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62p: Fix supported hardware for 1GHz OPP

From: Judith Mendez <jm@ti.com>

commit f434ec2200667d5362bd19f93a498d9b3f121588 upstream.

The 1GHz OPP is supported on speed grade "O" as well according to the
device datasheet [0], so fix the opp-supported-hw property to support
this speed grade for 1GHz OPP.
