Subject: fuse: remove unneeded offset assignment when filling write pages

From: Joanne Koong <joannelkoong@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 6fd26f50857698c6f07a9e6b149247925fadb8fd ]

With the change in aee03ea7ff98 ("fuse: support large folios for
writethrough writes"), this old line for setting ap->descs[0].offset is
now obsolete and unneeded. This should have been removed as part of
aee03ea7ff98.
