Subject: perf tools: Fix missing feature check for inherit + SAMPLE_READ

From: Namhyung Kim <namhyung@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 367377f45c0b568882567f797b7b18b263505be7 ]

It should also have PERF_SAMPLE_TID to enable inherit and PERF_SAMPLE_READ
on recent kernels.  Not having _TID makes the feature check wrongly detect
the inherit and _READ support.

It was reported that the following command failed due to the error in
the missing feature check on Intel SPR machines.

  $ perf record -e '{cpu/mem-loads-aux/S,cpu/mem-loads,ldlat=3/PS}' -- ls
  Error:
  Failure to open event 'cpu/mem-loads,ldlat=3/PS' on PMU 'cpu' which will be removed.
  Invalid event (cpu/mem-loads,ldlat=3/PS) in per-thread mode, enable system wide with '-a'.
