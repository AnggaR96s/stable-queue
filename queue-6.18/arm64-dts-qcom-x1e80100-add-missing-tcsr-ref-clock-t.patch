Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add missing TCSR ref clock to the DP PHYs

From: Abel Vesa <abel.vesa@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 0907cab01ff9746ecf08592edd9bd85d2636be58 ]

The DP PHYs on X1E80100 need the ref clock which is provided by the
TCSR CC.

The current X Elite devices supported upstream work fine without this
clock, because the boot firmware leaves this clock enabled. But we should
not rely on that. Also, even though this change breaks the ABI, it is
needed in order to make the driver disables this clock along with the
other ones, for a proper bring-down of the entire PHY.

So lets attach it to each of the DP PHYs in order to do that.
