Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Fix compile warnings for USB HS
 controller

From: Krishna Kurapati <krishna.kurapati@oss.qualcomm.com>

[ Upstream commit 0dab10c38282e6ef87ef88efb99d4106cce7ed33 ]

With W=1, the following error comes up:

Warning (graph_child_address): /soc@0/usb@a2f8800/usb@a200000/ports: graph node has single child node 'port@0', #address-cells/#size-cells are not necessary

This could be since the controller is only HS capable and only one port
node is added.

Fixes: 4af46b7bd66f ("arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add USB nodes")
