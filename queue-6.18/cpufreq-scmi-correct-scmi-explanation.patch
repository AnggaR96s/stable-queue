Subject: cpufreq: scmi: correct SCMI explanation

From: Sergey Shtylyov <s.shtylyov@auroraos.dev>

[ Upstream commit 8c376f337a7e31c42949247e24eaad9a30d6c62c ]

SCMI stands for System Control and Management Interface, not System Control
and Power Interface -- apparently, Sudeep Holla copied this line from his
SCPI driver and then just forgot to update the acronym explanation... :-)

Fixes: 99d6bdf33877 ("cpufreq: add support for CPU DVFS based on SCMI message protocol")
