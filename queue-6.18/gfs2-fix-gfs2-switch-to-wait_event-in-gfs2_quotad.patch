Subject: gfs2: Fix "gfs2: Switch to wait_event in gfs2_quotad"

From: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruenba@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit dff1fb6d8b7abe5b1119fa060f5d6b3370bf10ac ]

Commit e4a8b5481c59a ("gfs2: Switch to wait_event in gfs2_quotad") broke
cyclic statfs syncing, so the numbers reported by "df" could easily get
completely out of sync with reality.  Fix this by reverting part of
commit e4a8b5481c59a for now.

A follow-up commit will clean this code up later.
