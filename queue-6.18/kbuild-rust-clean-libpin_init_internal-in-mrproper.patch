Subject: kbuild: rust: clean libpin_init_internal in mrproper

From: Chen Miao <chenmiao@openatom.club>

commit a44bfed9df8a514962e2cb076d9c0b594caeff36 upstream.

When I enabled Rust compilation, I wanted to clean up its output, so I
used make mrproper. However, I was still able to find that
libpin_init_internal.so in the rust directory was not deleted, while
all other corresponding outputs were cleared.

Thus add it to the `MRPROPER_FILES` list.
