Subject: mfd: tps65219: Implement LOCK register handling for TPS65214

From: Kory Maincent (TI.com) <kory.maincent@bootlin.com>

[ Upstream commit d3fcf276b501a82d4504fd5b1ed40249546530d1 ]

The TPS65214 PMIC variant has a LOCK_REG register that prevents writes to
nearly all registers when locked. Unlock the registers at probe time and
leave them unlocked permanently.

This approach is justified because:
- Register locking is very uncommon in typical system operation
- No code path is expected to lock the registers during runtime
- Adding a custom regmap write function would add overhead to every
  register write, including voltage changes triggered by CPU OPP
  transitions from the cpufreq governor which could happen quite
  frequently
