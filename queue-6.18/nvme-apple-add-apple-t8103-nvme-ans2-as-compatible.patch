Subject: nvme-apple: add "apple,t8103-nvme-ans2" as compatible

From: Janne Grunau <j@jannau.net>

commit 7d3fa7e954934fbda0a017ac1c305b7b10ecceef upstream.

After discussion with the devicetree maintainers we agreed to not extend
lists with the generic compatible "apple,nvme-ans2" anymore [1]. Add
"apple,t8103-nvme-ans2" as fallback compatible as it is the SoC the
driver and bindings were written for.
