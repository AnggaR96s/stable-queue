Subject: pinctrl: intel: Add code name documentation

From: Raag Jadav <raag.jadav@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit fc32c5725fbe1164d353400389d3e29d19960a3a ]

Intel pinctrl drivers support large set of platforms and the IPs are
often reused by their different variants, but it's currently not possible
to figure out the exact driver that supports specific variant. Add user
friendly documentation for them.
