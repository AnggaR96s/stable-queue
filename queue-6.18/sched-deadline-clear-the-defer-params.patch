Subject: sched/deadline: Clear the defer params

From: Joel Fernandes <joelagnelf@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit 3cb3b27693bf30defb16aa096158a3b24583b8d2 ]

The defer params were not cleared in __dl_clear_params. Clear them.

Without this is some of my test cases are flaking and the DL timer is
not starting correctly AFAICS.
