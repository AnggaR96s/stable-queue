Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm8750: Fix BAM DMA probing

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@oss.qualcomm.com>

[ Upstream commit 1c6192ec9c4ab8bdb7b2cf8763b7ef7e38671ffe ]

Bindings always required "qcom,num-ees" and "num-channels" properties,
as reported by dtbs_check:

  sm8750-mtp.dtb: dma-controller@1dc4000 (qcom,bam-v1.7.4): 'anyOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
    'qcom,powered-remotely' is a required property
    'num-channels' is a required property
    'qcom,num-ees' is a required property
    'clocks' is a required property
    'clock-names' is a required property

However since commit 5068b5254812 ("dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: Fix DT
error handling for num-channels/ees") missing properties are actually
fatal and BAM does not probe:

  bam-dma-engine 1dc4000.dma-controller: num-channels unspecified in dt
  bam-dma-engine 1dc4000.dma-controller: probe with driver bam-dma-engine failed with error -22
