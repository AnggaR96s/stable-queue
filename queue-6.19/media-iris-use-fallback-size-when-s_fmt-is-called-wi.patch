Subject: media: iris: use fallback size when S_FMT is called without
 width/height

From: Val Packett <val@packett.cool>

[ Upstream commit 4980721cb97d6c47700ab61a048ac8819cfeec87 ]

According to 4.5.1.5 of the M2M stateful decoder UAPI documentation,
providing the width and the height to S_FMT is "required only if it
cannot be parsed from the stream", otherwise they can be left as 0
and the S_FMT implementation is expected to return a valid placeholder
resolution that would let REQBUFS succeed.

iris was missing the fallback, so clients like rpi-ffmpeg wouldn't work.
Fix by adding an explicit fallback to defaults.

Fixes: b530b95de22c ("media: iris: implement s_fmt, g_fmt and try_fmt ioctls")
