Subject: wifi: cfg80211: Fix use_for flag update on BSS refresh
MIME-Version: 1.0

[ Upstream commit 4073ea516106e5f98ed0476f89cdede8baa98d37 ]

Userspace may fail to connect to certain BSS that were initially
marked as unusable due to regulatory restrictions (use_for = 0,
e.g., 6 GHz power type mismatch). Even after these restrictions
are removed and the BSS becomes usable, connection attempts still
fail.

The issue occurs in cfg80211_update_known_bss() where the use_for
flag is updated using bitwise AND (&=) instead of direct assignment.
Once a BSS is marked with use_for = 0, the AND operation masks out
any subsequent non-zero values, permanently keeping the flag at 0.
This causes __cfg80211_get_bss(), invoked by nl80211_assoc_bss(), to
fail the check "(bss->pub.use_for & use_for) != use_for", thereby
blocking association.

Replace the bitwise AND operation with direct assignment so the use_for
flag accurately reflects the current BSS state.
