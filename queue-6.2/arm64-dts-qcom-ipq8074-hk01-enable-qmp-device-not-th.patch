Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074-hk01: enable QMP device, not the PHY node

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 72630ba422b70ea0874fc90d526353cf71c72488 ]

Correct PCIe PHY enablement to refer the QMP device nodes rather than
PHY device nodes. QMP nodes have 'status = "disabled"' property in the
ipq8074.dtsi, while PHY nodes do not correspond to the actual device and
do not have the status property.

Fixes: e8a7fdc505bb ("arm64: dts: ipq8074: qcom: Re-arrange dts nodes based on address")
