Subject: fork: allow CLONE_NEWTIME in clone3 flags

From: Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

commit a402f1e35313fc7ce2ca60f543c4402c2c7c3544 upstream.

Currently, calling clone3() with CLONE_NEWTIME in clone_args->flags
fails with -EINVAL. This is because CLONE_NEWTIME intersects with
CSIGNAL. However, CSIGNAL was deprecated when clone3 was introduced in
commit 7f192e3cd316 ("fork: add clone3"), allowing re-use of that part
of clone flags.

Fix this by explicitly allowing CLONE_NEWTIME in clone3_args_valid. This
is also in line with the respective check in check_unshare_flags which
allow CLONE_NEWTIME for unshare().

Fixes: 769071ac9f20 ("ns: Introduce Time Namespace")
