Subject: parport_pc: Set up mode and ECR masks for Oxford Semiconductor
 devices

From: Maciej W. Rozycki <macro@orcam.me.uk>

[ Upstream commit c087df8d1e7dc2e764d11234d84b5af46d500f16 ]

No Oxford Semiconductor PCI or PCIe parallel port device supports the
Parallel Port FIFO mode.  All support the PS/2 Parallel Port mode and
the Enhanced Parallel Port mode via the ECR register.  The original 5V
PCI OX16PCI954 device does not support the Extended Capabilities Port
mode, the Test mode or the Configuration mode, but all the other OxSemi
devices do, including in particular the 3.3V PCI OXmPCI954 device and
the universal voltage PCI OXuPCI954 device.  All the unsupported modes
are marked reserved in the relevant datasheets.

Accordingly enable the `base_hi' BAR for the 954 devices to enable PS2
and EPP mode support via the ECR register, however mask the COMPAT mode
and, until we have a way to determine what chip variant it is that we
poke at, also the ECP mode, and mask the COMPAT mode only for all the
remaining OxSemi devices, fixing errors like:

parport0: FIFO is stuck
FIFO write timed out

and a non-functional port when the Parallel Port FIFO mode is selected.

Complementing the fix apply an ECR mask for all these devices, which are
documented to only permit writing to the mode field of the ECR register
with a bit pattern of 00001 required to be written to bits 4:0 on mode
field writes.  No nFault or service interrupts are implemented, which
will therefore never have to be enabled, though bit 2 does report the
FIFO threshold status to be polled for in the ECP mode where supported.

We have a documented case of writing 1 to bit 2 causing a lock-up with
at least one OX12PCI840 device (from old drivers/parport/ChangeLog):

2001-10-10  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* parport_pc.c: Support for OX12PCI840 PCI card (reported by
	mk@daveg.com).  Lock-ups diagnosed by Ronnie Arosa (and now we
	just don't trust its ECR).

which commit adbd321a17cc ("parport_pc: add base_hi BAR for oxsemi_840")
must have broken and by applying an ECR mask here we prevent the lock-up
from triggering.  This could have been the reason for requiring 00001 to
be written to bits 4:0 of ECR.

Update the inline comment accordingly; it has come from Linux 2.4.12
back in 2001 and predates the introduction of OXmPCI954 and OXuPCI954
devices that do support ECP.
