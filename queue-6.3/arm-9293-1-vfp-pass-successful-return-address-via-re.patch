Subject: ARM: 9293/1: vfp: Pass successful return address via register R3

From: Ard Biesheuvel <ardb@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 3a2bdad0b46649cc73fb3b3f9e2b91ef97a7fa63 ]

In preparation for reimplementing the do_vfp()->vfp_support_entry()
handover in C code, switch to using R3 to pass the 'success' return
address, rather than R9, as it cannot be used for parameter passing.
