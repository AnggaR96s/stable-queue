Subject: net/mlx5: Devcom, fix error flow in mlx5_devcom_register_device

From: Shay Drory <shayd@nvidia.com>

commit af87194352cad882d787d06fb7efa714acd95427 upstream.

In case devcom allocation is failed, mlx5 is always freeing the priv.
However, this priv might have been allocated by a different thread,
and freeing it might lead to use-after-free bugs.
Fix it by freeing the priv only in case it was allocated by the
running thread.

Fixes: fadd59fc50d0 ("net/mlx5: Introduce inter-device communication mechanism")
