Subject: spi: spi-geni-qcom: Select FIFO mode for chip select

From: Vijaya Krishna Nivarthi <quic_vnivarth@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 4c329f5da7cfa366bacfda1328a025dd38951317 ]

Spi geni driver switches between FIFO and DMA modes based on xfer length.
FIFO mode relies on M_CMD_DONE_EN interrupt for completion while DMA mode
relies on XX_DMA_DONE.
During dynamic switching, if FIFO mode is chosen, FIFO related interrupts
are enabled and DMA related interrupts are disabled. And viceversa.
Chip select shares M_CMD_DONE_EN interrupt with FIFO to check completion.
Now, if a chip select operation is preceded by a DMA xfer, M_CMD_DONE_EN
interrupt would have been disabled and hence it will never receive one
resulting in timeout.

For chip select, in addition to setting the xfer mode to FIFO,
select_mode() to FIFO so that required interrupts are enabled.
