Subject: ARM: dts: qcom: strip prefix from PMIC files

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 455a4c46e023ab84263eae0fc7acca9a5ee8b7ac ]

As the vendor DTS files were moved to per-vendor subdirs, there no need
to use common prefixes. Drop the `qcom-' prefix from PMIC dtsi file.
This makes 32-bit qcom/ dts files closer to arm64 ones.
