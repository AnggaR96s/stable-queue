Subject: arm64: dts: imx8mm-beacon: Fix RTC capacitive load

From: Adam Ford <aford173@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 2e98d456666d63f897ba153210bcef9d78ba0f3a ]

Although not noticeable when used every day, the RTC appears to drift when
left to sit over time.  This is due to the capacitive load not being
properly set. Fix RTC drift by correcting the capacitive load setting
from 7000 to 12500, which matches the actual hardware configuration.
