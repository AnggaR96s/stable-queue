Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 1473ff0b69de68b23ce9874548cdabc64d72725e ]

The QCS40x platforms use PMS405 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
