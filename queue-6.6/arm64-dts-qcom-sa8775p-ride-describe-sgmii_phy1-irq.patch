Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sa8775p-ride: Describe sgmii_phy1 irq

From: Andrew Halaney <ahalaney@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 454557d0032d088b4f467f0c541f98edb01fe431 ]

There's an irq hooked up, so let's describe it.

Prior to commit 9757300d2750
("pinctrl: qcom: Add intr_target_width field to support increased number of interrupt targets")
one would not see the IRQ fire, despite some (invasive) debugging
showing that the GPIO was in fact asserted, resulting in the interface
staying down.

Now that the IRQ is properly routed we can describe it.
