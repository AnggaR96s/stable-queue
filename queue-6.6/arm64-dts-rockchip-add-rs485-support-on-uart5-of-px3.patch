Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: add rs485 support on uart5 of
 px30-ringneck-haikou

From: Farouk Bouabid <farouk.bouabid@theobroma-systems.com>

[ Upstream commit 5963d97aa780619ffb66cf4886c0ca1175ccbd3e ]

A hardware switch can set the rs485 transceiver into half or full duplex
mode.

Switching to the half-duplex mode requires the user to enable em485 on
uart5 using ioctl, DE/RE are both connected to GPIO0_B5 which is the
RTS signal for uart0. Implement GPIO0_B5 as rts-gpios with RTS_ON_SEND
option enabled (default) so that driver mode gets enabled while sending
(RTS high) and receiver mode gets enabled while not sending (RTS low).

In full-duplex mode (em485 is disabled), DE is connected to GPIO0_B5 and
RE is grounded (enabled). Since GPIO0_B5 is implemented as rts-gpios, the
driver mode gets enabled whenever we want to send something and RE is not
affected (always enabled) in this case by the state of RTS.
