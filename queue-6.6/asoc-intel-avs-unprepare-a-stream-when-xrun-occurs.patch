Subject: ASoC: Intel: avs: Unprepare a stream when XRUN occurs

From: Cezary Rojewski <cezary.rojewski@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit cfca1637bc2b6b1e4f191d2f0b25f12402fbbb26 ]

The pcm->prepare() function may be called multiple times in a row by the
userspace, as mentioned in the documentation. The driver shall take that
into account and prevent redundancy. However, the exact same function is
called during XRUNs and in such case, the particular stream shall be
reset and setup anew.
