Subject: io_uring/cancel: de-unionize file and user_data in struct
 io_cancel_data

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>

[ Upstream commit 22dbb0987bd1e0ec3b1e4ad20756a98f99aa4a08 ]

By having them share the same space in struct io_cancel_data, it ends up
disallowing IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_FD|IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_USERDATA from
working. Eg you cannot match on both a file and user_data for
cancelation purposes. This obviously isn't a common use case as nobody
has reported this, but it does result in -ENOENT potentially being
returned when trying to match on both, rather than actually doing what
the API says it would.

Fixes: 4bf94615b888 ("io_uring: allow IORING_OP_ASYNC_CANCEL with 'fd' key")
