Subject: net_sched: Prevent creation of classes with TC_H_ROOT

From: Cong Wang <xiyou.wangcong@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 0c3057a5a04d07120b3d0ec9c79568fceb9c921e ]

The function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT as a termination
condition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlog
counters. However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, the
traversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching the
actual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained.
In case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.

Prevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT
(0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types, as suggested by Jamal.
