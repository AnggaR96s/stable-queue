Subject: nilfs2: do not propagate ENOENT error from nilfs_btree_propagate()

From: Ryusuke Konishi <konishi.ryusuke@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 8e39fbb1edbb4ec9d7c1124f403877fc167fcecd ]

In preparation for writing logs, in nilfs_btree_propagate(), which makes
parent and ancestor node blocks dirty starting from a modified data block
or b-tree node block, if the starting block does not belong to the b-tree,
i.e.  is isolated, nilfs_btree_do_lookup() called within the function
fails with -ENOENT.

In this case, even though -ENOENT is an internal code, it is propagated to
the log writer via nilfs_bmap_propagate() and may be erroneously returned
to system calls such as fsync().

Fix this issue by changing the error code to -EINVAL in this case, and
having the bmap layer detect metadata corruption and convert the error
code appropriately.
