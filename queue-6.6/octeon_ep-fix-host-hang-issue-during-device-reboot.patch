Subject: octeon_ep: Fix host hang issue during device reboot

From: Sathesh B Edara <sedara@marvell.com>

[ Upstream commit 34f42736b325287a7b2ce37e415838f539767bda ]

When the host loses heartbeat messages from the device,
the driver calls the device-specific ndo_stop function,
which frees the resources. If the driver is unloaded in
this scenario, it calls ndo_stop again, attempting to free
resources that have already been freed, leading to a host
hang issue. To resolve this, dev_close should be called
instead of the device-specific stop function.dev_close
internally calls ndo_stop to stop the network interface
and performs additional cleanup tasks. During the driver
unload process, if the device is already down, ndo_stop
is not called.
