Subject: qibfs: fix _another_ leak

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

[ Upstream commit bdb43af4fdb39f844ede401bdb1258f67a580a27 ]

failure to allocate inode => leaked dentry...

this one had been there since the initial merge; to be fair,
if we are that far OOM, the odds of failing at that particular
allocation are low...
