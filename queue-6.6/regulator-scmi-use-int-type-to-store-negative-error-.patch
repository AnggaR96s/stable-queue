Subject: regulator: scmi: Use int type to store negative error codes

From: Qianfeng Rong <rongqianfeng@vivo.com>

[ Upstream commit 9d35d068fb138160709e04e3ee97fe29a6f8615b ]

Change the 'ret' variable from u32 to int to store negative error codes or
zero returned by of_property_read_u32().

Storing the negative error codes in unsigned type, doesn't cause an issue
at runtime but it's ugly as pants. Additionally, assigning negative error
codes to unsigned type may trigger a GCC warning when the -Wsign-conversion
flag is enabled.

No effect on runtime.
