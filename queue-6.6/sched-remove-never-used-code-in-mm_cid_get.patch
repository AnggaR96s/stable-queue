Subject: sched: Remove never used code in mm_cid_get()

From: Andy Shevchenko <andriy.shevchenko@linux.intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 53abe3e1c154628cc74e33a1bfcd865656e433a5 ]

Clang is not happy with set but unused variable (this is visible
with `make W=1` build:

  kernel/sched/sched.h:3744:18: error: variable 'cpumask' set but not used [-Werror,-Wunused-but-set-variable]

It seems like the variable was never used along with the assignment
that does not have side effects as far as I can see.  Remove those
altogether.

Fixes: 223baf9d17f2 ("sched: Fix performance regression introduced by mm_cid")
