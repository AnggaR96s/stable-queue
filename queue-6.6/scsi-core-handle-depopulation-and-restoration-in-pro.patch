Subject: scsi: core: Handle depopulation and restoration in progress

From: Douglas Gilbert <dgilbert@interlog.com>

[ Upstream commit 2bbeb8d12404cf0603f513fc33269ef9abfbb396 ]

The default handling of the NOT READY sense key is to wait for the device
to become ready. The "wait" is assumed to be relatively short. However
there is a sub-class of NOT READY that have the "... in progress" phrase in
their additional sense code and these can take much longer.  Following on
from commit 505aa4b6a883 ("scsi: sd: Defer spinning up drive while SANITIZE
is in progress") we now have element depopulation and restoration that can
take a long time.  For example, over 24 hours for a 20 TB, 7200 rpm hard
disk to depopulate 1 of its 20 elements.

Add handling of ASC/ASCQ: 0x4,0x24 (depopulation in progress)
and ASC/ASCQ: 0x4,0x25 (depopulation restoration in progress)
to sd.c . The scsi_lib.c has incomplete handling of these
two messages, so complete it.
