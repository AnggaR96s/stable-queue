Subject: workqueue: Only assign rescuer work when really needed

From: Lai Jiangshan <jiangshan.ljs@antgroup.com>

[ Upstream commit 7b05c90b3302cf3d830dfa6f8961376bcaf43b94 ]

If the pwq does not need rescue (normal workers have been created or
become available), the rescuer can immediately move on to other stalled
pwqs.
