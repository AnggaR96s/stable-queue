Subject: x86/bugs: Report correct retbleed mitigation status

From: David Kaplan <david.kaplan@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 930f2361fe542a00de9ce6070b1b6edb976f1165 ]

On Intel CPUs, the default retbleed mitigation is IBRS/eIBRS but this
requires that a similar spectre_v2 mitigation is applied.  If the user
selects a different spectre_v2 mitigation (like spectre_v2=retpoline) a
warning is printed but sysfs will still report 'Mitigation: IBRS' or
'Mitigation: Enhanced IBRS'.  This is incorrect because retbleed is not
mitigated, and IBRS is not actually set.

Fix this by choosing RETBLEED_MITIGATION_NONE in this scenario so the
kernel correctly reports the system as vulnerable to retbleed.
