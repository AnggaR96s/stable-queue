Subject: xfs: mark data structures corrupt on EIO and ENODATA

From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit f39854a3fb2f06dc69b81ada002b641ba5b4696b ]

I learned a few things this year: first, blk_status_to_errno can return
ENODATA for critical media errors; and second, the scrub code doesn't
mark data structures as corrupt on ENODATA or EIO.

Currently, scrub failing to capture these errors isn't all that
impactful -- the checking code will exit to userspace with EIO/ENODATA,
and xfs_scrub will log a complaint and exit with nonzero status.  Most
people treat fsck tools failing as a sign that the fs is corrupt, but
online fsck should mark the metadata bad and keep moving.
