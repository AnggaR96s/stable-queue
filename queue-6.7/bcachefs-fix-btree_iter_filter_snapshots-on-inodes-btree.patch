Subject: bcachefs: Fix BTREE_ITER_FILTER_SNAPSHOTS on inodes btree

From: Kent Overstreet <kent.overstreet@linux.dev>

commit 204f45140faa0772d2ca1b3de96d1c0fb3db8e77 upstream.

If we're in FILTER_SNAPSHOTS mode and we start scanning a range of the
keyspace where no keys are visible in the current snapshot, we have a
problem - we'll scan for a very long time before scanning terminates.

Awhile back, this was fixed for most cases with peek_upto() (and
assertions that enforce that it's being used).

But the fix missed the fact that the inodes btree is different - every
key offset is in a different snapshot tree, not just the inode field.

Fixes:
