Subject: [PATCH] hugetlbfs mmap ENOMEM failure


2.6.15's hugepage faulting introduced huge_pages_needed accounting into
hugetlbfs: to count how many pages are already in cache, for spot check
on how far a new mapping may be allowed to extend the file.  But it's
muddled: each hugepage found covers HPAGE_SIZE, not PAGE_SIZE.  Once
pages were already in cache, it would overshoot, wrap its hugepages
count backwards, and so fail a harmless repeat mapping with -ENOMEM.
Fixes the problem found by Don Dupuis.
