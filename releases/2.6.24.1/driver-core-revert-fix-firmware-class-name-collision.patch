Subject: Driver core: Revert "Fix Firmware class name collision"
To: Greg KH <gregkh@suse.de>
Message-ID: <20080129213500.GA18423@humbolt.us.dell.com>
Content-Disposition: inline

From: Michael E Brown <Michael_E_Brown@dell.com>

patch 7d640c4a5b36c4733460065db1554da924044511 in mainline.

This reverts commit 109f0e93b6b728f03c1eb4af02bc25d71b646c59.

The original patch breaks BIOS updates on all Dell machines. The path to
the firmware file for the dell_rbu driver changes, which breaks all of
the userspace tools which rely on it.

Note that this patch re-introduces a problem with i2c name collision
that was previously fixed by this patch.
