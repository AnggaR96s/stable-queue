Subject: x86: tone down mtrr_trim_uncached_memory() warning

From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

commit bf3647c44bc76c43c4b2ebb4c37a559e899ac70e upstream.

kerneloops.org is reporting a lot of these warnings that come due to
vmware not setting up any MTRRs for emulated CPUs:

| Reported 709 times (14696 total reports)
| BIOS bug (often in VMWare) where the MTRR's are set up incorrectly
| or not at all
|
| This warning was last seen in version 2.6.29-rc2-git1, and first
| seen in 2.6.24.
|
| More info:
|   http://www.kerneloops.org/searchweek.php?search=mtrr_trim_uncached_memory

Keep a one-liner KERN_INFO about it - so that we have so notice if empty
MTRRs are caused by native hardware/BIOS weirdness.
