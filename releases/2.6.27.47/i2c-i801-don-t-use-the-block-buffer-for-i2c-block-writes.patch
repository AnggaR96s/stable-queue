Subject: i2c-i801: Don't use the block buffer for I2C block writes

From: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>

commit c074c39d62306efa5ba7c69c1a1531bc7333d252 upstream.

Experience has shown that the block buffer can only be used for SMBus
(not I2C) block transactions, even though the datasheet doesn't
mention this limitation.
