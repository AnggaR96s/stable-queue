Subject: USB: xhci: Set correct max packet size for HS/FS control endpoints.

From: Sarah Sharp <sarah.a.sharp@linux.intel.com>

commit 47aded8ade9fee6779b121b2b156235f261239d7 upstream.

Set the max packet size for the default control endpoint on high speed
devices to be 64 bytes.  High speed devices always have a max packet size
of 64 bytes.  There's no use setting it to eight for the initial 8 byte
descriptor fetch and then issuing (and waiting for) an evaluate context
command to update it to 64 bytes for the subsequent control transfers.

The USB core guesses that the max packet size on a full speed control
endpoint is 64 bytes, and then updates it after the first 8-byte
descriptor fetch.  Change the initial setup for the xHCI internal
representation of the full speed device to have a 64 byte max packet size.
