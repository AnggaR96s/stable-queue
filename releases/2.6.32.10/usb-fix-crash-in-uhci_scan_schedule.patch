Subject: USB: fix crash in uhci_scan_schedule

From: Pete Zaitcev <zaitcev@redhat.com>

commit d23356da714595b888686d22cd19061323c09190 upstream.

When hardware is removed on a Stratus, the system may crash like this:

ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:7c:00.1 disabled
Trying to free nonexistent resource <00000000a8000000-00000000afffffff>

This occurs because an interrupt scans uhci->skelqh, which is
being freed. We do the right thing: disable the interrupts in the
device, and do not do any processing if the interrupt is shared
with other source, but it's possible that another CPU gets
delayed somewhere (e.g. loops) until we started freeing.

The agreed-upon solution is to wait for interrupts to play out
before proceeding. No other bareers are neceesary.

A backport of this patch was tested on a 2.6.18 based kernel.
Testing of 2.6.32-based kernels is under way, but it takes us
forever (months) to turn this around. So I think it's a good
patch and we should keep it.

Tracked in RH bz#516851
