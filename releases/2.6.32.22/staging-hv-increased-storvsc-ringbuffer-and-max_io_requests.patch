Subject: staging: hv: Increased storvsc ringbuffer and max_io_requests

From: Hank Janssen <hjanssen@microsoft.com>

commit 15dd1c9f53b31cdc84b8072a88c23fa09527c596 upstream.

Increased storvsc ringbuffer and max_io_requests. This now more
closely mimics the numbers on Hyper-V. And will allow more IO requests
to take place for the SCSI driver.

Max_IO is set to double from what it was before, Hyper-V allows it and
we have had appliance builder requests to see if it was a problem to
increase the number.

Ringbuffer size for storvsc is now increased because I have seen A few buffer
problems on extremely busy systems. They were Set pretty low before.
And since max_io_requests is increased I Really needed to increase the buffer
as well.
