Subject: cfg80211: fix race between deauth and assoc response

From: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>

commit 3bdb2d48c5f58c781a4099c99044384a23620884 upstream.

Joseph Nahmias reported, in http://bugs.debian.org/562016,
that he was getting the following warning (with some log
around the issue):

  ath0: direct probe to AP 00:11:95:77:e0:b0 (try 1)

It is not clear to me how the first "direct probe" here
happens, but this seems to be a race condition, if the
user requests to deauth after requesting assoc, but before
the assoc response is received. In that case, it may
happen that mac80211 tries to report the assoc success to
cfg80211, but gets blocked on the wdev lock that is held
because the user is requesting the deauth.

The result is that we run into a warning. This is mostly
harmless, but maybe cause an unexpected event to be sent
to userspace; we'd send an assoc success event although
userspace was no longer expecting that.

To fix this, remove the warning and check whether the
race happened and in that case abort processing.
