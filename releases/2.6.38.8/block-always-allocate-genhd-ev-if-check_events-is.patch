Subject: block: always allocate genhd->ev if check_events is
 implemented

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit 75e3f3ee3c64968d42f4843ec49e579f84b5aa0c upstream.

9fd097b149 (block: unexport DISK_EVENT_MEDIA_CHANGE for legacy/fringe
drivers) removed DISK_EVENT_MEDIA_CHANGE from legacy/fringe block
drivers which have inadequate ->check_events().  Combined with earlier
change 7c88a168da (block: don't propagate unlisted DISK_EVENTs to
userland), this enables using ->check_events() for internal processing
while avoiding enabling in-kernel block event polling which can lead
to infinite event loop.

Unfortunately, this made many drivers including floppy without any bit
set in disk->events and ->async_events in which case disk_add_events()
simply skipped allocation of disk->ev, which disables whole event
handling.  As ->check_events() is still used during open processing
for revalidation, this can lead to open failure.

This patch always allocates disk->ev if ->check_events is implemented.
In the long term, it would make sense to simply include the event
structure inline into genhd as it's now used by virtually all block
devices.
