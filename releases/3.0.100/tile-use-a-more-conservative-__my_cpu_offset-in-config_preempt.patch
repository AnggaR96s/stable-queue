Subject: tile: use a more conservative __my_cpu_offset in CONFIG_PREEMPT

From: Chris Metcalf <cmetcalf@tilera.com>

commit f862eefec0b68e099a9fa58d3761ffb10bad97e1 upstream.

It turns out the kernel relies on barrier() to force a reload of the
percpu offset value.  Since we can't easily modify the definition of
barrier() to include "tp" as an output register, we instead provide a
definition of __my_cpu_offset as extended assembly that includes a fake
stack read to hazard against barrier(), forcing gcc to know that it
must reread "tp" and recompute anything based on "tp" after a barrier.

This fixes observed hangs in the slub allocator when we are looping
on a percpu cmpxchg_double.

A similar fix for ARMv7 was made in June in change 509eb76ebf97.
