Subject: Net, libertas: Resolve memory leak in if_spi_host_to_card()

From: Jesper Juhl <jj@chaosbits.net>

commit fe09b32a4361bea44169b2063e8c867cabb6a8ba upstream.

If we hit the default case in the switch in if_spi_host_to_card() we'll leak
the memory we allocated for 'packet'. This patch resolves the leak by freeing
the allocated memory in that case.
