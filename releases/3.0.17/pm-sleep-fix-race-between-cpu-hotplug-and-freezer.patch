Subject: PM / Sleep: Fix race between CPU hotplug and freezer

From: "Srivatsa S. Bhat" <srivatsa.bhat@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit 79cfbdfa87e84992d509e6c1648a18e1d7e68c20 upstream.

The CPU hotplug notifications sent out by the _cpu_up() and _cpu_down()
functions depend on the value of the 'tasks_frozen' argument passed to them
(which indicates whether tasks have been frozen or not).
(Examples for such CPU hotplug notifications: CPU_ONLINE, CPU_ONLINE_FROZEN,
CPU_DEAD, CPU_DEAD_FROZEN).

Thus, it is essential that while the callbacks for those notifications are
running, the state of the system with respect to the tasks being frozen or
not remains unchanged, *throughout that duration*. Hence there is a need for
synchronizing the CPU hotplug code with the freezer subsystem.

Since the freezer is involved only in the Suspend/Hibernate call paths, this
patch hooks the CPU hotplug code to the suspend/hibernate notifiers
PM_[SUSPEND|HIBERNATE]_PREPARE and PM_POST_[SUSPEND|HIBERNATE] to prevent
the race between CPU hotplug and freezer, thus ensuring that CPU hotplug
notifications will always be run with the state of the system really being
what the notifications indicate, _throughout_ their execution time.
