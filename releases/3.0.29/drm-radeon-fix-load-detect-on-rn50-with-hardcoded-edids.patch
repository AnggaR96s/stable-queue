Subject: drm/radeon: fix load detect on rn50 with hardcoded EDIDs.

From: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>

commit a09d431f344d854e4fe9cfac44f78cb8202f3eb7 upstream.

When the force changes went in back in 3.3.0, we ended up returning
disconnected in the !force case, and the connected in when forced,
as it hit the hardcoded check.

Fix it so all exits go via the hardcoded check and stop spurious
modesets on platforms with hardcoded EDIDs.
