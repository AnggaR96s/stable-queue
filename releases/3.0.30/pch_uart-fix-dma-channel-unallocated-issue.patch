Subject: pch_uart: Fix dma channel unallocated issue

From: Tomoya MORINAGA <tomoya.rohm@gmail.com>

commit af6d17cdc8c89aeb3101f0d27cd32fc0592b40b2 upstream.

This driver anticipates pch_uart_verify_port() is not called
during installation.
However, actually pch_uart_verify_port() is called during
installation.
As a result, memory access violation occurs like below.

0. initial value: use_dma=0
1. starup()
    - dma channel is not allocated because use_dma=0
2. pch_uart_verify_port()
    - Set use_dma=1
3. UART processing acts DMA mode because use_dma=1
     - memory access violation occurs!

This patch fixes the issue.

Solution:
Whenever pch_uart_verify_port() is called and then
dma channel is not allocated, the channel should be allocated.
