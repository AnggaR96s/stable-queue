Subject: ALSA: hda - Add Realtek ALC280 codec support

From: David Henningsson <david.henningsson@canonical.com>

commit befae82e2906cb7155020876a531b0b8c6c8d8c8 upstream.

This chip looks very similar to ALC269 and ALC27* variants. The bug reporter
has verified that sound was working after this patch had been applied.
