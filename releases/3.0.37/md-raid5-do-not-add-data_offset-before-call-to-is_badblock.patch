Subject: md/raid5: Do not add data_offset before call to is_badblock

From: majianpeng <majianpeng@gmail.com>

commit 6c0544e255dd6582a9899572e120fb55d9f672a4 upstream.

In chunk_aligned_read() we are adding data_offset before calling
is_badblock.  But is_badblock also adds data_offset, so that is bad.

So move the addition of data_offset to after the call to
is_badblock.

This bug was introduced by commit 31c176ecdf3563140e639
     md/raid5: avoid reading from known bad blocks.
which first appeared in 3.0.  So that patch is suitable for any
-stable kernel from 3.0.y onwards.  However it will need minor
revision for most of those (as the comment didn't appear until
recently).
