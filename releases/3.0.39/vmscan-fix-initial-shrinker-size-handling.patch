Subject: vmscan: fix initial shrinker size handling

From: Konstantin Khlebnikov <khlebnikov@openvz.org>

commit 635697c663f38106063d5659f0cf2e45afcd4bb5 upstream.

Stable note: The commit [acf92b48: vmscan: shrinker->nr updates race and
	go wrong] aimed to reduce excessive reclaim of slab objects but
	had bug in how it treated shrinker functions that returned -1.

A shrinker function can return -1, means that it cannot do anything
without a risk of deadlock.  For example prune_super() does this if it
cannot grab a superblock refrence, even if nr_to_scan=0.  Currently we
interpret this -1 as a ULONG_MAX size shrinker and evaluate `total_scan'
according to this.  So the next time around this shrinker can cause
really big pressure.  Let's skip such shrinkers instead.

Also make total_scan signed, otherwise the check (total_scan < 0) below
never works.
