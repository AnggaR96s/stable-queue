Subject: Squashfs: fix mount time sanity check for corrupted superblock

From: Phillip Lougher <phillip@squashfs.org.uk>

commit cc37f75a9ffbbfcb1c3297534f293c8284e3c5a6 upstream.

A Squashfs filesystem containing nothing but an empty directory,
although unusual and ultimately pointless, is still valid.

The directory_table >= next_table sanity check rejects these
filesystems as invalid because the directory_table is empty and
equal to next_table.
