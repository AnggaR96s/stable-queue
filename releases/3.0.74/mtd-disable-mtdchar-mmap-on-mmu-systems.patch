Subject: mtd: Disable mtdchar mmap on MMU systems

From: David Woodhouse <David.Woodhouse@intel.com>

commit f5cf8f07423b2677cebebcebc863af77223a4972 upstream.

This code was broken because it assumed that all MTD devices were map-based.
Disable it for now, until it can be fixed properly for the next merge window.
