Subject: bonding: IFF_BONDING is not stripped on enslave failure


From: "nikolay@redhat.com" <nikolay@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit b6a5a7b9a528a8b4c8bec940b607c5dd9102b8cc ]

While enslaving a new device and after IFF_BONDING flag is set, in case
of failure it is not stripped from the device's priv_flags while
cleaning up, which could lead to other problems.
Cleaning at err_close because the flag is set after dev_open().

v2: no change
