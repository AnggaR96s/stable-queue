Subject: perf: Disable monitoring on setuid processes for regular users

From: Stephane Eranian <eranian@google.com>

commit 2976b10f05bd7f6dab9f9e7524451ddfed656a89 upstream.

There was a a bug in setup_new_exec(), whereby
the test to disabled perf monitoring was not
correct because the new credentials for the
process were not yet committed and therefore
the get_dumpable() test was never firing.

The patch fixes the problem by moving the
perf_event test until after the credentials
are committed.
