Subject: caif: Fix BUG() with network namespaces

commit 08613e4626c06ca408fc55071f6aedee36986a87 upstream.

The caif code will register its own pernet_operations, and then register
a netdevice_notifier. Each time the netdevice_notifier is triggered,
it'll do some stuff... including a lookup of its own pernet stuff with
net_generic().

If the net_generic() call ever returns NULL, the caif code will BUG().
That doesn't seem *so* unreasonable, I suppose — it does seem like it
should never happen.

However, it *does* happen. When we clone a network namespace,
setup_net() runs through all the pernet_operations one at a time. It
gets to loopback before it gets to caif. And loopback_net_init()
registers a netdevice... while caif hasn't been initialised. So the caif
netdevice notifier triggers, and immediately goes BUG().

We could imagine a complex and overengineered solution to this generic
class of problems, but this patch takes the simple approach. It just
makes caif_device_notify() *not* go looking for its pernet data
structures if the device it's being notified about isn't a caif device
in the first place.
