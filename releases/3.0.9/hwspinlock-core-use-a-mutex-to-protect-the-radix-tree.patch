Subject: hwspinlock/core: use a mutex to protect the radix tree

From: Juan Gutierrez <jgutierrez@ti.com>

commit 93b465c2e186d96fb90012ba0f9372eb9952e732 upstream.

Since we're using non-atomic radix tree allocations, we
should be protecting the tree using a mutex and not a
spinlock.

Non-atomic allocations and process context locking is good enough,
as the tree is manipulated only when locks are registered/
unregistered/requested/freed.

The locks themselves are still protected by spinlocks of course,
and mutexes are not involved in the locking/unlocking paths.
