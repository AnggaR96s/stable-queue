Subject: net: hold sock reference while processing tx timestamps

From: Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>

commit da92b194cc36b5dc1fbd85206aeeffd80bee0c39 upstream.

The pair of functions,

 * skb_clone_tx_timestamp()
 * skb_complete_tx_timestamp()

were designed to allow timestamping in PHY devices. The first
function, called during the MAC driver's hard_xmit method, identifies
PTP protocol packets, clones them, and gives them to the PHY device
driver. The PHY driver may hold onto the packet and deliver it at a
later time using the second function, which adds the packet to the
socket's error queue.

As pointed out by Johannes, nothing prevents the socket from
disappearing while the cloned packet is sitting in the PHY driver
awaiting a timestamp. This patch fixes the issue by taking a reference
on the socket for each such packet. In addition, the comments
regarding the usage of these function are expanded to highlight the
rule that PHY drivers must use skb_complete_tx_timestamp() to release
the packet, in order to release the socket reference, too.

These functions first appeared in v2.6.36.
