Subject: USB: Fix runtime wakeup on OHCI

From: Matthew Garrett <mjg@redhat.com>

commit a8b43c00ef06aec49b9fe0a5bad8a6a320e4d27b upstream.

At least some OHCI hardware (such as the MCP89) fails to flag any change
in the host status register or the port status registers when receiving
a remote wakeup while in D3 state. This results in the controller being
resumed but no device state change being noticed, at which point the
controller is put back to sleep again. Since there doesn't seem to be any
reliable way to identify the state change, just unconditionally resume the
hub. It'll be put back to sleep in the near future anyway if there are no
active devices attached to it.
