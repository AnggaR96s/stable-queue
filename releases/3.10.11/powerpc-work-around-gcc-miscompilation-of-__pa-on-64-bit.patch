Subject: powerpc: Work around gcc miscompilation of __pa() on 64-bit

From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>

commit bdbc29c19b2633b1d9c52638fb732bcde7a2031a upstream.

On 64-bit, __pa(&static_var) gets miscompiled by recent versions of
gcc as something like:

        addis 3,2,.LANCHOR1+4611686018427387904@toc@ha
        addi 3,3,.LANCHOR1+4611686018427387904@toc@l

This ends up effectively ignoring the offset, since its bottom 32 bits
are zero, and means that the result of __pa() still has 0xC in the top
nibble.  This happens with gcc 4.8.1, at least.

To work around this, for 64-bit we make __pa() use an AND operator,
and for symmetry, we make __va() use an OR operator.  Using an AND
operator rather than a subtraction ends up with slightly shorter code
since it can be done with a single clrldi instruction, whereas it
takes three instructions to form the constant (-PAGE_OFFSET) and add
it on.  (Note that MEMORY_START is always 0 on 64-bit.)
