Subject: net: usb: Add HP hs2434 device to ZLP exception table

From: Rob Gardner <robmatic@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 03803a59e32453ee5737c6096a295f748f03cc49 ]

This patch adds another entry (HP hs2434 Mobile Broadband) to the list
of exceptional devices that require a zero length packet in order to
function properly. This list was added in commit 844e88f0. The hs2434
is manufactured by Sierra Wireless, who also produces the MC7710,
which the ZLP exception list was created for in the first place. So
hopefully it is just this one producer's devices that will need this
workaround.

Tested on a DM1-4310NR HP notebook, which does not function without this
change.
