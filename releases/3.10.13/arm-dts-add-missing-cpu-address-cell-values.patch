Subject: ARM: dts: add missing cpu #address-cell values

From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

commit 8b2efa896cc618e055e90c9d9600e7c8388ae3b7 upstream.

A recent series has added CPU numbers to a lot of dts files,
but unfortunately in a few cases the #address-cells
and #size-cells values are missing, which causes build warnings.
This adds the missing ones for sunxi and sama5 that I found
through build testing.
