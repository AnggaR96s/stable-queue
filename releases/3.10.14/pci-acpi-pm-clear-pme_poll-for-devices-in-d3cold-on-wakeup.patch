Subject: PCI / ACPI / PM: Clear pme_poll for devices in D3cold on wakeup

From: "Rafael J. Wysocki" <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

commit 834145156bedadfb50121f0bc5e9d9f9f942bcca upstream.

Commit 448bd85 (PCI/PM: add PCIe runtime D3cold support) added a
piece of code to pci_acpi_wake_dev() causing that function to behave
in a special way for devices in D3cold (so that their configuration
registers are not accessed before those devices are resumed).
However, it didn't take the clearing of the pme_poll flag into
account.  That has to be done for all devices, even if they are in
D3cold, or pci_pme_list_scan() will not know that wakeup has been
signaled for the device and will poll its PME Status bit
unnecessarily.

Fix the problem by moving the clearing of the pme_poll flag in
pci_acpi_wake_dev() before the code introduced by commit 448bd85.
