From: Davidlohr Bueso <davidlohr@hp.com>

commit 18ccee263c7e250a57f01c9434658f11f4118a64 upstream.

The initial documentation was a bit incomplete, update accordingly.

  * General sysv ipc locking scheme:
- *  when doing ipc id lookups, take the ids->rwsem
- *      rcu_read_lock()
- *          obtain the ipc object (kern_ipc_perm)
- *          perform security, capabilities, auditing and permission checks, etc.
- *          acquire the ipc lock (kern_ipc_perm.lock) throught ipc_lock_object()
- *             perform data updates (ie: SET, RMID, LOCK/UNLOCK commands)
+ *	rcu_read_lock()
+ *          obtain the ipc object (kern_ipc_perm) by looking up the id in an idr
+ *	    tree.
+ *	    - perform initial checks (capabilities, auditing and permission,
+ *	      etc).
+ *	    - perform read-only operations, such as STAT, INFO commands.
+ *	      acquire the ipc lock (kern_ipc_perm.lock) through
+ *	      ipc_lock_object()
+ *		- perform data updates, such as SET, RMID commands and
+ *		  mechanism-specific operations (semop/semtimedop,
+ *		  msgsnd/msgrcv, shmat/shmdt).
+ *	    drop the ipc lock, through ipc_unlock_object().
+ *	rcu_read_unlock()
+ *
+ *  The ids->rwsem must be taken when:
+ *	- creating, removing and iterating the existing entries in ipc
+ *	  identifier sets.
+ *	- iterating through files under /proc/sysvipc/
+ *
+ *  Note that sems have a special fast path that avoids kern_ipc_perm.lock -
+ *  see sem_lock().
