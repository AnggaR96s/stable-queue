Subject: libata: disable a disk via libata.force params

From: "Robin H. Johnson" <robbat2@gentoo.org>

commit b8bd6dc36186fe99afa7b73e9e2d9a98ad5c4865 upstream.

A user on StackExchange had a failing SSD that's soldered directly
onto the motherboard of his system. The BIOS does not give any option
to disable it at all, so he can't just hide it from the OS via the
BIOS.

The old IDE layer had hdX=noprobe override for situations like this,
but that was never ported to the libata layer.

This patch implements a disable flag for libata.force.

Example use:

 libata.force=2.0:disable

[v2 of the patch, removed the nodisable flag per Tejun Heo]
