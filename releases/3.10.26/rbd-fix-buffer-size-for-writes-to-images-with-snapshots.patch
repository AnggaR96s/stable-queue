Subject: rbd: fix buffer size for writes to images with snapshots

From: Josh Durgin <josh.durgin@inktank.com>

commit 03507db631c94a48e316c7f638ffb2991544d617 upstream.

rbd_osd_req_create() needs to know the snapshot context size to create
a buffer large enough to send it with the message front. It gets this
from the img_request, which was not set for the obj_request yet. This
resulted in trying to write past the end of the front payload, hitting
this BUG:

libceph: BUG_ON(p > msg->front.iov_base + msg->front.iov_len);

Fix this by associating the obj_request with its img_request
immediately after it's created, before the osd request is created.
