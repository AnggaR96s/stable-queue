Subject: mm/memory-failure.c: move refcount only in !MF_COUNT_INCREASED

From: Naoya Horiguchi <n-horiguchi@ah.jp.nec.com>

commit 8d547ff4ac5927245e0833ac18528f939da0ee0e upstream.

mce-test detected a test failure when injecting error to a thp tail
page.  This is because we take page refcount of the tail page in
madvise_hwpoison() while the fix in commit a3e0f9e47d5e
("mm/memory-failure.c: transfer page count from head page to tail page
after split thp") assumes that we always take refcount on the head page.

When a real memory error happens we take refcount on the head page where
memory_failure() is called without MF_COUNT_INCREASED set, so it seems
to me that testing memory error on thp tail page using madvise makes
little sense.

This patch cancels moving refcount in !MF_COUNT_INCREASED for valid
testing.
