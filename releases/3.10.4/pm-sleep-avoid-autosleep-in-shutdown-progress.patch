Subject: PM / Sleep: avoid 'autosleep' in shutdown progress

From: Liu ShuoX <shuox.liu@intel.com>

commit e5248a111bf4048a9f3fab1a9c94c4630a10592a upstream.

Prevent automatic system suspend from happening during system
shutdown by making try_to_suspend() check system_state and return
immediately if it is not SYSTEM_RUNNING.

This prevents the following breakage from happening (scenario from
Zhang Yanmin):

 Kernel starts shutdown and calls all device driver's shutdown
 callback.  When a driver's shutdown is called, the last wakelock is
 released and suspend-to-ram starts.  However, as some driver's shut
 down callbacks already shut down devices and disabled runtime pm,
 the suspend-to-ram calls driver's suspend callback without noticing
 that device is already off and causes crash.
