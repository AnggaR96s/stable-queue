Subject: tracing: Remove locking trace_types_lock from tracing_reset_all_online_cpus()

From: "Steven Rostedt (Red Hat)" <rostedt@goodmis.org>

commit 09d8091c024ec88d1541d93eb8ddb2bd5cf10c39 upstream.

Commit a82274151af "tracing: Protect ftrace_trace_arrays list in trace_events.c"
added taking the trace_types_lock mutex in trace_events.c as there were
several locations that needed it for protection. Unfortunately, it also
encapsulated a call to tracing_reset_all_online_cpus() which also takes
the trace_types_lock, causing a deadlock.

This happens when a module has tracepoints and has been traced. When the
module is removed, the trace events module notifier will grab the
trace_types_lock, do a bunch of clean ups, and also clears the buffer
by calling tracing_reset_all_online_cpus. This doesn't happen often
which explains why it wasn't caught right away.

Commit a82274151af was marked for stable, which means this must be
sent to stable too.
