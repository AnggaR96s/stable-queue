Subject: powerpc: Save the TAR register earlier

From: Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>

commit c2d52644e2da8a07ecab5ca62dd0bc563089e8dc upstream.

This moves us to save the Target Address Register (TAR) a earlier in
__switch_to.  It introduces a new function save_tar() to do this.

We need to save the TAR earlier as we will overwrite it in the transactional
memory reclaim/recheckpoint path.  We are going to do this in a subsequent
patch which will fix saving the TAR register when it's modified inside a
transaction.
