Subject: perf/x86: Fix intel QPI uncore event definitions

From: Vince Weaver <vincent.weaver@maine.edu>

commit c9601247f8f3fdc18aed7ed7e490e8dfcd07f122 upstream.

John McCalpin reports that the "drs_data" and "ncb_data" QPI
uncore events are missing the "extra bit" and always return zero
values unless the bit is properly set.

More details from him:

 According to the Xeon E5-2600 Product Family Uncore Performance
 Monitoring Guide, Table 2-94, about 1/2 of the QPI Link Layer events
 (including the ones that "perf" calls "drs_data" and "ncb_data") require
 that the "extra bit" be set.

 This was confusing for a while -- a note at the bottom of page 94 says
 that the "extra bit" is bit 16 of the control register.
 Unfortunately, Table 2-86 clearly says that bit 16 is reserved and must
 be zero.  Looking around a bit, I found that bit 21 appears to be the
 correct "extra bit", and further investigation shows that "perf" actually
 agrees with me:
	[root@c560-003.stampede]# cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/uncore_qpi_0/format/event
	config:0-7,21

 So the command
	# perf -e "uncore_qpi_0/event=drs_data/"
 Is the same as
	# perf -e "uncore_qpi_0/event=0x02,umask=0x08/"
 While it should be
	# perf -e "uncore_qpi_0/event=0x102,umask=0x08/"

 I confirmed that this last version gives results that agree with the
 amount of data that I expected the STREAM benchmark to move across the QPI
 link in the second (cross-chip) test of the original script.
