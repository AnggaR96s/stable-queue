Subject: kernel/resource.c: fix muxed resource handling in __request_region()

From: Simon Guinot <simon.guinot@sequanux.org>

commit 59ceeaaf355fa0fb16558ef7c24413c804932ada upstream.

In __request_region, if a conflict with a BUSY and MUXED resource is
detected, then the caller goes to sleep and waits for the resource to be
released.  A pointer on the conflicting resource is kept.  At wake-up
this pointer is used as a parent to retry to request the region.

A first problem is that this pointer might well be invalid (if for
example the conflicting resource have already been freed).  Another
problem is that the next call to __request_region() fails to detect a
remaining conflict.  The previously conflicting resource is passed as a
parameter and __request_region() will look for a conflict among the
children of this resource and not at the resource itself.  It is likely
to succeed anyway, even if there is still a conflict.

Instead, the parent of the conflicting resource should be passed to
__request_region().

As a fix, this patch doesn't update the parent resource pointer in the
case we have to wait for a muxed region right after.
