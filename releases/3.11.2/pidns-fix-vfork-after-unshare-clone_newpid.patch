Subject: pidns: fix vfork() after unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)

From: Oleg Nesterov <oleg@redhat.com>

commit e79f525e99b04390ca4d2366309545a836c03bf1 upstream.

Commit 8382fcac1b81 ("pidns: Outlaw thread creation after
unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)") nacks CLONE_VM if the forking process unshared
pid_ns, this obviously breaks vfork:

	int main(void)
	{
		assert(unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWPID) == 0);
		assert(vfork() >= 0);
		_exit(0);
		return 0;
	}

fails without this patch.

Change this check to use CLONE_SIGHAND instead.  This also forbids
CLONE_THREAD automatically, and this is what the comment implies.

We could probably even drop CLONE_SIGHAND and use CLONE_THREAD, but it
would be safer to not do this.  The current check denies CLONE_SIGHAND
implicitely and there is no reason to change this.

Eric said "CLONE_SIGHAND is fine.  CLONE_THREAD would be even better.
Having shared signal handling between two different pid namespaces is
the case that we are fundamentally guarding against."
