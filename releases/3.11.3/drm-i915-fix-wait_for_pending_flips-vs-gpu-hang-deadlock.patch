Subject: drm/i915: fix wait_for_pending_flips vs gpu hang deadlock

From: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>

commit 17e1df07df0fbc77696a1e1b6ccf9f2e5af70e40 upstream.

My g33 here seems to be shockingly good at hitting them all. This time
around kms_flip/flip-vs-panning-vs-hang blows up:

intel_crtc_wait_for_pending_flips correctly checks for gpu hangs and
if a gpu hang is pending aborts the wait for outstanding flips so that
the setcrtc call will succeed and release the crtc mutex. And the gpu
hang handler needs that lock in intel_display_handle_reset to be able
to complete outstanding flips.

The problem is that we can race in two ways:
- Waiters on the dev_priv->pending_flip_queue aren't woken up after
  we've the reset as pending, but before we actually start the reset
  work. This means that the waiter doesn't notice the pending reset
  and hence will keep on hogging the locks.

  Like with dev->struct_mutex and the ring->irq_queue wait queues we
  there need to wake up everyone that potentially holds a lock which
  the reset handler needs.

- intel_display_handle_reset was called _after_ we've already
  signalled the completion of the reset work. Which means a waiter
  could sneak in, grab the lock and never release it (since the
  pageflips won't ever get released).

  Similar to resetting the gem state all the reset work must complete
  before we update the reset counter. Contrary to the gem reset we
  don't need to have a second explicit wake up call since that will
  have happened already when completing the pageflips. We also don't
  have any issues that the completion happens while the reset state is
  still pending - wait_for_pending_flips is only there to ensure we
  display the right frame. After a gpu hang&reset events such
  guarantees are out the window anyway. This is in contrast to the gem
  code where too-early wake-up would result in unnecessary restarting
  of ioctls.

Also, since we've gotten these various deadlocks and ordering
constraints wrong so often throw copious amounts of comments at the
code.

This deadlock regression has been introduced in the commit which added
the pageflip reset logic to the gpu hang work:

    drm/i915: Finish page flips and update primary planes after a GPU reset

v2:
- Add comments to explain how the wake_up serves as memory barriers
  for the atomic_t reset counter.
- Improve the comments a bit as suggested by Chris Wilson.
- Extract the wake_up calls before/after the reset into a little
  i915_error_wake_up and unconditionally wake up the
  pending_flip_queue waiters, again as suggested by Chris Wilson.

v3: Throw copious amounts of comments at i915_error_wake_up as
suggested by Chris Wilson.
