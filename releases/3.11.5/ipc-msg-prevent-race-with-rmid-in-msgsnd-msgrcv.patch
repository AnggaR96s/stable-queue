Subject: ipc,msg: prevent race with rmid in msgsnd,msgrcv

From: Davidlohr Bueso <davidlohr@hp.com>

commit 4271b05a227dc6175b66c3d9941aeab09048aeb2 upstream.

This fixes a race in both msgrcv() and msgsnd() between finding the msg
and actually dealing with the queue, as another thread can delete shmid
underneath us if we are preempted before acquiring the
kern_ipc_perm.lock.

Manfred illustrates this nicely:

Assume a preemptible kernel that is preempted just after

    msq = msq_obtain_object_check(ns, msqid)

in do_msgrcv().  The only lock that is held is rcu_read_lock().

Now the other thread processes IPC_RMID.  When the first task is
resumed, then it will happily wait for messages on a deleted queue.

Fix this by checking for if the queue has been deleted after taking the
lock.
