Subject: ipc/sem.c: optimize sem_lock()

From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>

commit 6d07b68ce16ae9535955ba2059dedba5309c3ca1 upstream.

Operations that need access to the whole array must guarantee that there
are no simple operations ongoing.  Right now this is achieved by
spin_unlock_wait(sem->lock) on all semaphores.

If complex_count is nonzero, then this spin_unlock_wait() is not
necessary, because it was already performed in the past by the thread
that increased complex_count and even though sem_perm.lock was dropped
inbetween, no simple operation could have started, because simple
operations cannot start when complex_count is non-zero.
