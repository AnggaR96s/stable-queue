Subject: media: stb0899_drv: Don't use dynamic static allocation

From: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <m.chehab@samsung.com>

commit ba4746423488aafa435739c32bfe0758f3dd5d77 upstream.

Dynamic static allocation is evil, as Kernel stack is too low, and
compilation complains about it on some archs:
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/stb0899_drv.c:540:1: warning: 'stb0899_write_regs' uses dynamic stack allocation [enabled by default]
Instead, let's enforce a limit for the buffer. Considering that I2C
transfers are generally limited, and that devices used on USB has a
max data length of 64 bytes for	the control URBs.
So, it seem safe to use 64 bytes as the hard limit for all those devices.
 On most cases, the limit is a way lower than that, but	this limit
is small enough to not affect the Kernel stack, and it is a no brain
limit, as using smaller ones would require to either carefully each
driver or to take a look on each datasheet.
