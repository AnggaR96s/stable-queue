Subject: hwmon: HIH-6130: Support I2C bus drivers without I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_QUICK

From: José Miguel Gonçalves <jose.goncalves@inov.pt>

commit efabcc2123f0ed47870033b8d6fc73b50d76d635 upstream.

Some I2C bus drivers do not allow zero-length data transfers which are
required to start a measurement with the HIH6130/1 sensor. Nevertheless,
we can overcome this limitation by writing a zero dummy byte. This byte
is ignored by the sensor and was verified to be working with the OMAP
I2C bus driver in a BeagleBone board.
