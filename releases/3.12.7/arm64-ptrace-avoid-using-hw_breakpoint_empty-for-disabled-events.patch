Subject: arm64: ptrace: avoid using HW_BREAKPOINT_EMPTY for disabled events

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

commit cdc27c27843248ae7eb0df5fc261dd004eaa5670 upstream.

Commit 8f34a1da35ae ("arm64: ptrace: use HW_BREAKPOINT_EMPTY type for
disabled breakpoints") fixed an issue with GDB trying to zero breakpoint
control registers. The problem there is that the arch hw_breakpoint code
will attempt to create a (disabled), execute breakpoint of length 0.

This will fail validation and report unexpected failure to GDB. To avoid
this, we treated disabled breakpoints as HW_BREAKPOINT_EMPTY, but that
seems to have broken with recent kernels, causing watchpoints to be
treated as TYPE_INST in the core code and returning ENOSPC for any
further breakpoints.

This patch fixes the problem by prioritising the `enable' field of the
breakpoint: if it is cleared, we simply update the perf_event_attr to
indicate that the thing is disabled and don't bother changing either the
type or the length. This reinforces the behaviour that the breakpoint
control register is essentially read-only apart from the enable bit
when disabling a breakpoint.
