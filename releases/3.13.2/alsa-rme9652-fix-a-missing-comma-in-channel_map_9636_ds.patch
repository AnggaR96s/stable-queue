Subject: ALSA: rme9652: fix a missing comma in channel_map_9636_ds[]

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 770bd4bf2e664939a9dacd3d26ec9ff7a3933210 upstream.

The lack of comma leads to the wrong channel for an SPDIF channel.
Unfortunately this wasn't caught by compiler because it's still a
valid expression.
