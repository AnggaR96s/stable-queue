Subject: arm64: vdso: fix coarse clock handling

From: Nathan Lynch <nathan_lynch@mentor.com>

commit 069b918623e1510e58dacf178905a72c3baa3ae4 upstream.

When __kernel_clock_gettime is called with a CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE or
CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE clock id, it returns incorrectly to whatever the
caller has placed in x2 ("ret x2" to return from the fast path).  Fix
this by saving x30/LR to x2 only in code that will call
__do_get_tspec, restoring x30 afterward, and using a plain "ret" to
return from the routine.

Also: while the resulting tv_nsec value for CLOCK_REALTIME and
CLOCK_MONOTONIC must be computed using intermediate values that are
left-shifted by cs_shift (x12, set by __do_get_tspec), the results for
coarse clocks should be calculated using unshifted values
(xtime_coarse_nsec is in units of actual nanoseconds).  The current
code shifts intermediate values by x12 unconditionally, but x12 is
uninitialized when servicing a coarse clock.  Fix this by setting x12
to 0 once we know we are dealing with a coarse clock id.
