Subject: asix: Do full reset during ax88772_bind

From: Charles Keepax <ckeepax@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

[ Upstream commit 436c2a5036b6ffe813310df2cf327d3b69be0734 ]

commit 3cc81d85ee01 ("asix: Don't reset PHY on if_up for ASIX 88772")
causes the ethernet on Arndale to no longer function. This appears to
be because the Arndale ethernet requires a full reset before it will
function correctly, however simply reverting the above patch causes
problems with ethtool settings getting reset.

It seems the problem is that the ethernet is not properly reset during
bind, and indeed the code in ax88772_bind that resets the device is a
very small subset of the actual ax88772_reset function. This patch uses
ax88772_reset in place of the existing reset code in ax88772_bind which
removes some code duplication and fixes the ethernet on Arndale.

It is still possible that the original patch causes some issues with
suspend and resume but that seems like a separate issue and I haven't
had a chance to test that yet.
