Subject: powerpc/perf: Prevent kernel address leak to userspace via BHRB buffer

From: Madhavan Srinivasan <maddy@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit bb19af816025d495376bd76bf6fbcf4244f9a06d ]

The current Branch History Rolling Buffer (BHRB) code does not check
for any privilege levels before updating the data from BHRB. This
could leak kernel addresses to userspace even when profiling only with
userspace privileges. Add proper checks to prevent it.
