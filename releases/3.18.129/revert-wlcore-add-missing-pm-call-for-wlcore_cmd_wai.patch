Subject: Revert "wlcore: Add missing PM call for
 wlcore_cmd_wait_for_event_or_timeout()"

This reverts commit cbc56a12da05d5333a9020c4d7854ad7d0b5a31d which was
upstream commit 4ec7cece87b3ed21ffcd407c62fb2f151a366bc1.

From Dietmar May's report on the stable mailing list
(https://www.spinics.net/lists/stable/msg272201.html):

> I've run into some problems which appear due to (a) recent patch(es) on
> the wlcore wifi driver.
>
> 4.4.160 - commit 3fdd34643ffc378b5924941fad40352c04610294
> 4.9.131 - commit afeeecc764436f31d4447575bb9007732333818c
>
> Earlier versions (4.9.130 and 4.4.159 - tested back to 4.4.49) do not
> exhibit this problem. It is still present in 4.9.141.
>
> master as of 4.20.0-rc4 does not exhibit this problem.
>
> Basically, during client association when in AP mode (running hostapd),
> handshake may or may not complete following a noticeable delay. If
> successful, then the driver fails consistently in warn_slowpath_null
> during disassociation. If unsuccessful, the wifi client attempts multiple
> times, sometimes failing repeatedly. I've had clients unable to connect
> for 3-5 minutes during testing, with the syslog filled with dozens of
> backtraces. syslog details are below.

> We're not doing anything explicit with power management. The device is an
> IoT edge gateway with battery backup, normally running on wall power. The
> battery is currently used solely to shut down the system cleanly to avoid
> filesystem corruption.
>
> The device tree is configured to keep power in suspend; but the device
> should never suspend, so in our case, there is no need to call
> wl1271_ps_elp_wakeup() or wl1271_ps_elp_sleep(), as occurs in the patch.
