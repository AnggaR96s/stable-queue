Subject: fuse: initialize the flock flag in fuse_file on allocation

From: Mateusz Jurczyk <mjurczyk@google.com>

commit 68227c03cba84a24faf8a7277d2b1a03c8959c2c upstream.

Before the patch, the flock flag could remain uninitialized for the
lifespan of the fuse_file allocation. Unless set to true in
fuse_file_flock(), it would remain in an indeterminate state until read in
an if statement in fuse_release_common(). This could consequently lead to
taking an unexpected branch in the code.

The bug was discovered by a runtime instrumentation designed to detect use
of uninitialized memory in the kernel.
