Subject: usb: quirks: Add no-lpm quirk for Moshi USB to Ethernet Adapter

From: Kai-Heng Feng <kai.heng.feng@canonical.com>

commit 7496cfe5431f21da5d27a8388c326397e3f0a5db upstream.

Moshi USB to Ethernet Adapter internally uses a Genesys Logic hub to
connect to Realtek r8153.

The Realtek r8153 ethernet does not work on the internal hub, no-lpm quirk
can make it work.

Since another r8153 dongle at my hand does not have the issue, so add
the quirk to the Genesys Logic hub instead.
