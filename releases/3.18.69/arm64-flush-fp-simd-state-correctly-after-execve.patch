Subject: arm64: flush FP/SIMD state correctly after execve()

From: Ard Biesheuvel <ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>

commit 674c242c9323d3c293fc4f9a3a3a619fe3063290 upstream.

When a task calls execve(), its FP/SIMD state is flushed so that
none of the original program state is observeable by the incoming
program.

However, since this flushing consists of setting the in-memory copy
of the FP/SIMD state to all zeroes, the CPU field is set to CPU 0 as
well, which indicates to the lazy FP/SIMD preserve/restore code that
the FP/SIMD state does not need to be reread from memory if the task
is scheduled again on CPU 0 without any other tasks having entered
userland (or used the FP/SIMD in kernel mode) on the same CPU in the
mean time. If this happens, the FP/SIMD state of the old program will
still be present in the registers when the new program starts.

So set the CPU field to the invalid value of NR_CPUS when performing
the flush, by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state().
