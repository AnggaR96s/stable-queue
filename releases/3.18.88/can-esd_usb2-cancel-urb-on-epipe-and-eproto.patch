Subject: can: esd_usb2: cancel urb on -EPIPE and -EPROTO

From: Martin Kelly <mkelly@xevo.com>

commit 7a31ced3de06e9878e4f9c3abe8f87d9344d8144 upstream.

In mcba_usb, we have observed that when you unplug the device, the driver will
endlessly resubmit failing URBs, which can cause CPU stalls. This issue
is fixed in mcba_usb by catching the codes seen on device disconnect
(-EPIPE and -EPROTO).

This driver also resubmits in the case of -EPIPE and -EPROTO, so fix it
in the same way.
