Subject: workqueue: skip nr_running sanity check in worker_enter_idle() if trustee is active

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit 544ecf310f0e7f51fa057ac2a295fc1b3b35a9d3 upstream.

worker_enter_idle() has WARN_ON_ONCE() which triggers if nr_running
isn't zero when every worker is idle.  This can trigger spuriously
while a cpu is going down due to the way trustee sets %WORKER_ROGUE
and zaps nr_running.

It first sets %WORKER_ROGUE on all workers without updating
nr_running, releases gcwq->lock, schedules, regrabs gcwq->lock and
then zaps nr_running.  If the last running worker enters idle
inbetween, it would see stale nr_running which hasn't been zapped yet
and trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE().

Fix it by performing the sanity check iff the trustee is idle.
