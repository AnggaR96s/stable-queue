Subject: Bluetooth: Fix using a NULL inquiry cache entry

From: Ram Malovany <ramm@ti.com>

commit 7cc8380eb10347016d95bf6f9d842c2ae6d12932 upstream.

If the device was not found in a list of found devices names of which
are pending.This may happen in a case when HCI Remote Name Request
was sent as a part of incoming connection establishment procedure.
Hence there is no need to continue resolving a next name as it will
be done upon receiving another Remote Name Request Complete Event.
This will fix a kernel crash when trying to use this entry to resolve
the next name.
