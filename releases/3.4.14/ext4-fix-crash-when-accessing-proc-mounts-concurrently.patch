Subject: ext4: fix crash when accessing /proc/mounts concurrently

From: Herton Ronaldo Krzesinski <herton.krzesinski@canonical.com>

commit 50df9fd55e4271e89a7adf3b1172083dd0ca199d upstream.

The crash was caused by a variable being erronously declared static in
token2str().

In addition to /proc/mounts, the problem can also be easily replicated
by accessing /proc/fs/ext4/<partition>/options in parallel:

$ cat /proc/fs/ext4/<partition>/options > options.txt

... and then running the following command in two different terminals:

$ while diff /proc/fs/ext4/<partition>/options options.txt; do true; done

This is also the cause of the following a crash while running xfstests
#234, as reported in the following bug reports:
