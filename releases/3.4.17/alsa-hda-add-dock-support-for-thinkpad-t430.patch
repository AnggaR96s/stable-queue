Subject: ALSA: hda - add dock support for Thinkpad T430

From: =?UTF-8?q?Stef=C3=A1n=20Freyr?= <stefan.freyr@gmail.com>

commit 84f98fdf7865fbd35b312eb39ea91e5618c514c7 upstream.

I have a Lenovo ThinkPad T430 and an UltraBase Series 3 docking
station.

Without this patch, if I plug my headphones into the jack on the
computer, everything works fine. The computer speakers mute and the
audio is played in the headphones. However, if I plug into the docking
station headphone jack the computer speakers are muted but there is no
audio in the headphones.
