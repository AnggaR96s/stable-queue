Subject: mtdchar: fix offset overflow detection

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

commit 9c603e53d380459fb62fec7cd085acb0b74ac18f upstream.

Sasha Levin has been running trinity in a KVM tools guest, and was able
to trigger the BUG_ON() at arch/x86/mm/pat.c:279 (verifying the range of
the memory type).  The call trace showed that it was mtdchar_mmap() that
created an invalid remap_pfn_range().

The problem is that mtdchar_mmap() does various really odd and subtle
things with the vma page offset etc, and uses the wrong types (and the
wrong overflow) detection for it.

For example, the page offset may well be 32-bit on a 32-bit
architecture, but after shifting it up by PAGE_SHIFT, we need to use a
potentially 64-bit resource_size_t to correctly hold the full value.

Also, we need to check that the vma length plus offset doesn't overflow
before we check that it is smaller than the length of the mtdmap region.

This fixes things up and tries to make the code a bit easier to read.
