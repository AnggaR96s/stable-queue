Subject: sfc: Fix efx_rx_buf_offset() for recycled pages

From: Ben Hutchings <bhutchings@solarflare.com>

This bug fix is only for stable branches older than 3.10.  The bug was
fixed upstream by commit 2768935a4660 ('sfc: reuse pages to avoid DMA
mapping/unmapping costs'), but that change is totally unsuitable for
stable.

Commit b590ace09d51 ('sfc: Fix efx_rx_buf_offset() in the presence of
swiotlb') added an explicit page_offset member to struct
efx_rx_buffer, which must be set consistently with the u.page and
dma_addr fields.  However, it failed to add the necessary assignment
in efx_resurrect_rx_buffer().  It also did not correct the calculation
of efx_rx_buffer::dma_addr in efx_resurrect_rx_buffer(), which assumes
that DMA-mapping a page will result in a page-aligned DMA address
(exactly what swiotlb violates).

Add the assignment of efx_rx_buffer::page_offset and change the
calculation of dma_addr to make use of it.
