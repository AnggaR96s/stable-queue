Subject: mm/mmap: check for RLIMIT_AS before unmapping

From: Cyril Hrubis <chrubis@suse.cz>

commit e8420a8ece80b3fe810415ecf061d54ca7fab266 upstream.

Fix a corner case for MAP_FIXED when requested mapping length is larger
than rlimit for virtual memory.  In such case any overlapping mappings
are unmapped before we check for the limit and return ENOMEM.

The check is moved before the loop that unmaps overlapping parts of
existing mappings.  When we are about to hit the limit (currently mapped
pages + len > limit) we scan for overlapping pages and check again
accounting for them.

This fixes situation when userspace program expects that the previous
mappings are preserved after the mmap() syscall has returned with error.
(POSIX clearly states that successfull mapping shall replace any
previous mappings.)

This corner case was found and can be tested with LTP testcase:

testcases/open_posix_testsuite/conformance/interfaces/mmap/24-2.c

In this case the mmap, which is clearly over current limit, unmaps
dynamic libraries and the testcase segfaults right after returning into
userspace.

I've also looked at the second instance of the unmapping loop in the
do_brk().  The do_brk() is called from brk() syscall and from vm_brk().
The brk() syscall checks for overlapping mappings and bails out when
there are any (so it can't be triggered from the brk syscall).  The
vm_brk() is called only from binmft handlers so it shouldn't be
triggered unless binmft handler created overlapping mappings.
