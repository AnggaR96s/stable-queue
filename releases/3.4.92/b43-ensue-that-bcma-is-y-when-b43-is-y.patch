Subject: b43: ensue that BCMA is "y" when B43 is "y"

From: Hauke Mehrtens <hauke@hauke-m.de>

commit 693026ef2e751fd94d2e6c71028e68343cc875d5 upstream.

When b43 gets build into the kernel and it should use bcma we have to
ensure that bcma was also build into the kernel and not as a module.
In this patch this is also done for SSB, although you can not
build b43 without ssb support for now.

This fixes a build problem reported by Randy Dunlap in
5187EB95.2060605@infradead.org
