Subject: vfs: dcache: fix deadlock in tree traversal

From: Miklos Szeredi <miklos@szeredi.hu>

commit 8110e16d42d587997bcaee0c864179e6d93603fe upstream.

IBM reported a deadlock in select_parent().  This was found to be caused
by taking rename_lock when already locked when restarting the tree
traversal.

There are two cases when the traversal needs to be restarted:

 1) concurrent d_move(); this can only happen when not already locked,
    since taking rename_lock protects against concurrent d_move().

 2) racing with final d_put() on child just at the moment of ascending
    to parent; rename_lock doesn't protect against this rare race, so it
    can happen when already locked.

Because of case 2, we need to be able to handle restarting the traversal
when rename_lock is already held.  This patch fixes all three callers of
try_to_ascend().

IBM reported that the deadlock is gone with this patch.

[ I rewrote the patch to be smaller and just do the "goto again" if the
  lock was already held, but credit goes to Miklos for the real work.
