Subject: ARM: OMAP: RX-51: change probe order of touchscreen and panel SPI devices

From: Aaro Koskinen <aaro.koskinen@iki.fi>

commit e65f131a14726e5f1b880a528271a52428e5b3a5 upstream.

Commit 9fdca9df (spi: omap2-mcspi: convert to module_platform_driver)
broke the SPI display/panel driver probe on RX-51/N900. The exact cause is
not fully understood, but it seems to be related to the probe order. SPI
communication to the panel driver (spi1.2) fails unless the touchscreen
(spi1.0) has been probed/initialized before. When the omap2-mcspi driver
was converted to a platform driver, it resulted in that the devices are
probed immediately after the board registers them in the order they are
listed in the board file.

Fix the issue by moving the touchscreen before the panel in the SPI
device list.

The patch fixes the following failure:

[    1.260955] acx565akm spi1.2: invalid display ID
[    1.265899] panel-acx565akm display0: acx_panel_probe panel detect error
[    1.273071] omapdss CORE error: driver probe failed: -19
