Subject: TTY: Fix tty miss restart after we turn off flow-control

From: Wang YanQing <udknight@gmail.com>

commit dab73b4eb9ef924a2b90dab84e539076d82b256f upstream.

I meet emacs hang in start if I do the operation below:
  1: echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
  2: emacs BigFile
  3: Press CTRL-S follow 2 immediately

Then emacs hang on, CTRL-Q can't resume, the terminal
hang on, you can do nothing with this terminal except
close it.

The reason is before emacs takeover control the tty,
we use CTRL-S to XOFF it. Then when emacs takeover the
control, it may don't use the flow-control, so emacs hang.
This patch fix it.

This patch will fix a kind of strange tty relation hang problem,
I believe I meet it with vim in ssh, and also see below bug report:
