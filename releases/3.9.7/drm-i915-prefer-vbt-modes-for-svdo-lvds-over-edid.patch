    drm/i915/sdvo: Use &intel_sdvo->ddc instead of intel_sdvo->i2c for DDC

Egbert Eich fixed a long-standing bug where we simply used a
non-working i2c controller to read the EDID for SDVO-LVDS panels.
Unfortunately some machines seem to not be able to cope with the mode
provided in the EDID. Specifically they seem to not be able to cope
with a 4x pixel mutliplier instead of a 2x one, which seems to have
been worked around by slightly changing the panels native mode in the
VBT so that the dotclock is just barely above 50MHz.

Since it took forever to notice the breakage it's fairly safe to
assume that at least for SDVO-LVDS panels the VBT contains fairly sane
data. So just switch around the order and use VBT modes first.

v2: Also add EDID modes just in case, and spell Egbert correctly.

v3: Elaborate a bit more about what's going on on Chris' machine.
