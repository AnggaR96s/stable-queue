Subject: ACPI / scan: Prefer devices without _HID for _ADR matching

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

commit fdad4e7a876a2cb3d2c1f04e5418c324e79fffef upstream.

Commit c2a6bbaf0c5f (ACPI / scan: Prefer devices without _HID/_CID
for _ADR matching) added a list_empty(&adev->pnp.ids) check to
find_child_checks() so as to catch situations in which the ACPI
core attempts to decode _ADR for a device having a _HID too which
is strictly against the spec.  However, it overlooked the fact that
the adev->pnp.ids list for the devices taken into account by
find_child_checks() may contain device IDs set internally by the
kernel, like "LNXVIDEO" (thanks to Zhang Rui for that realization),
and it broke the enumeration of those devices as a result.

To unbreak it, replace the overly coarse grained list_empty()
check with a much more precise check against the pnp.type.platform_id
flag which is only set for devices having a _HID (that's how it
should be done from the start, as having both _ADR and _CID is
actually permitted).
