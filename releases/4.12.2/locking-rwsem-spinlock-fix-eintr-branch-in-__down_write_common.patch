Subject: locking/rwsem-spinlock: Fix EINTR branch in __down_write_common()

From: Kirill Tkhai <ktkhai@virtuozzo.com>

commit a0c4acd2c220376b4e9690e75782d0c0afdaab9f upstream.

If a writer could been woken up, the above branch

	if (sem->count == 0)
		break;

would have moved us to taking the sem. So, it's
not the time to wake a writer now, and only readers
are allowed now. Thus, 0 must be passed to __rwsem_do_wake().

Next, __rwsem_do_wake() wakes readers unconditionally.
But we mustn't do that if the sem is owned by writer
in the moment. Otherwise, writer and reader own the sem
the same time, which leads to memory corruption in
callers.

rwsem-xadd.c does not need that, as:

  1) the similar check is made lockless there,
  2) in __rwsem_mark_wake::try_reader_grant we test,

that sem is not owned by writer.
