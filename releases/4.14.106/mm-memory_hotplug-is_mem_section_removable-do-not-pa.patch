Subject: mm, memory_hotplug: is_mem_section_removable do not pass the end of a
 zone

[ Upstream commit efad4e475c312456edb3c789d0996d12ed744c13 ]

Patch series "mm, memory_hotplug: fix uninitialized pages fallouts", v2.

Mikhail Zaslonko has posted fixes for the two bugs quite some time ago
[1].  I have pushed back on those fixes because I believed that it is
much better to plug the problem at the initialization time rather than
play whack-a-mole all over the hotplug code and find all the places
which expect the full memory section to be initialized.

We have ended up with commit 2830bf6f05fb ("mm, memory_hotplug:
initialize struct pages for the full memory section") merged and cause a
regression [2][3].  The reason is that there might be memory layouts
when two NUMA nodes share the same memory section so the merged fix is
simply incorrect.

In order to plug this hole we really have to be zone range aware in
those handlers.  I have split up the original patch into two.  One is
unchanged (patch 2) and I took a different approach for `removable'
crash.

This patch (of 2):

Mikhail has reported the following VM_BUG_ON triggered when reading sysfs
removable state of a memory block:

 page:000003d08300c000 is uninitialized and poisoned
 page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PagePoisoned(p))
 Call Trace:
   is_mem_section_removable+0xb4/0x190

 Last Breaking-Event-Address:
   is_mem_section_removable+0xb4/0x190
 Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception: panic_on_oops

The reason is that the memory block spans the zone boundary and we are
stumbling over an unitialized struct page.  Fix this by enforcing zone
range in is_mem_section_removable so that we never run away from a zone.
