Subject: crypto: sha256/arm - fix crash bug in Thumb2 build

[ Upstream commit 69216a545cf81b2b32d01948f7039315abaf75a0 ]

The SHA256 code we adopted from the OpenSSL project uses a rather
peculiar way to take the address of the round constant table: it
takes the address of the sha256_block_data_order() routine, and
substracts a constant known quantity to arrive at the base of the
table, which is emitted by the same assembler code right before
the routine's entry point.

However, recent versions of binutils have helpfully changed the
behavior of references emitted via an ADR instruction when running
in Thumb2 mode: it now takes the Thumb execution mode bit into
account, which is bit 0 af the address. This means the produced
table address also has bit 0 set, and so we end up with an address
value pointing 1 byte past the start of the table, which results
in crashes such as

Given that this affects older kernels as well, in case they are built
with a recent toolchain, apply a minimal backportable fix, which is
to emit another non-code label at the start of the routine, and
reference that instead. (This is similar to the current upstream state
of this file in OpenSSL)
