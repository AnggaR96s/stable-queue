Subject: net: stmmac: dwmac-rk: Don't fail if phy regulator is absent

From: Chen-Yu Tsai <wens@csie.org>

[ Upstream commit 3b25528e1e355c803e73aa326ce657b5606cda73 ]

The devicetree binding lists the phy phy as optional. As such, the
driver should not bail out if it can't find a regulator. Instead it
should just skip the remaining regulator related code and continue
on normally.

Skip the remainder of phy_power_on() if a regulator supply isn't
available. This also gets rid of the bogus return code.

Fixes: 2e12f536635f ("net: stmmac: dwmac-rk: Use standard devicetree property for phy regulator")
