[ Upstream commit fd9d63da17daf09c0099e3d5e3f0c0f03d9b251b ]

The kernel detects and uses some of the features based on the boot
CPU and expects that all the following CPUs conform to it. e.g,
with VHE and the boot CPU running at EL2, the kernel decides to
keep the kernel running at EL2. If another CPU is brought up without
this capability, we use custom hooks (via check_early_cpu_features())
to handle it. To handle such capabilities add support for detecting
and enabling capabilities based on the boot CPU.

A bit is added to indicate if the capability should be detected
early on the boot CPU. The infrastructure then ensures that such
capabilities are probed and "enabled" early on in the boot CPU
and, enabled on the subsequent CPUs.
