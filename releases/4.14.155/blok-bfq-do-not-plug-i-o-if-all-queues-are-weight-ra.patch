Subject: blok, bfq: do not plug I/O if all queues are weight-raised

From: Paolo Valente <paolo.valente@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit c8765de0adfcaaf4ffb2d951e07444f00ffa9453 ]

To reduce latency for interactive and soft real-time applications, bfq
privileges the bfq_queues containing the I/O of these
applications. These privileged queues, referred-to as weight-raised
queues, get a much higher share of the device throughput
w.r.t. non-privileged queues. To preserve this higher share, the I/O
of any non-weight-raised queue must be plugged whenever a sync
weight-raised queue, while being served, remains temporarily empty. To
attain this goal, bfq simply plugs any I/O (from any queue), if a sync
weight-raised queue remains empty while in service.

Unfortunately, this plugging typically lowers throughput with random
I/O, on devices with internal queueing (because it reduces the filling
level of the internal queues of the device).

This commit addresses this issue by restricting the cases where
plugging is performed: if a sync weight-raised queue remains empty
while in service, then I/O plugging is performed only if some of the
active bfq_queues are *not* weight-raised (which is actually the only
circumstance where plugging is needed to preserve the higher share of
the throughput of weight-raised queues). This restriction proved able
to boost throughput in really many use cases needing only maximum
throughput.
