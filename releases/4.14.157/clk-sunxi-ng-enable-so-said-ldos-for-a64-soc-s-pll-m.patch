Subject: clk: sunxi-ng: enable so-said LDOs for A64 SoC's pll-mipi clock

From: Icenowy Zheng <icenowy@aosc.io>

[ Upstream commit 859783d1390035e29ba850963bded2b4ffdf43b5 ]

In the user manual of A64 SoC, the bit 22 and 23 of pll-mipi control
register is called "LDO{1,2}_EN", and according to the BSP source code
from Allwinner , the LDOs are enabled during the clock's enabling
process.

The clock failed to generate output if the two LDOs are not enabled.

Add the two bits to the clock's gate bits, so that the LDOs are enabled
when the PLL is enabled.
