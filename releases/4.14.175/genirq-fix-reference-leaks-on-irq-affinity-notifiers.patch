Subject: genirq: Fix reference leaks on irq affinity notifiers

From: Edward Cree <ecree@solarflare.com>

commit df81dfcfd6991d547653d46c051bac195cd182c1 upstream.

The handling of notify->work did not properly maintain notify->kref in two
 cases:
1) where the work was already scheduled, another irq_set_affinity_locked()
   would get the ref and (no-op-ly) schedule the work.  Thus when
   irq_affinity_notify() ran, it would drop the original ref but not the
   additional one.
2) when cancelling the (old) work in irq_set_affinity_notifier(), if there
   was outstanding work a ref had been got for it but was never put.
Fix both by checking the return values of the work handling functions
 (schedule_work() for (1) and cancel_work_sync() for (2)) and put the
 extra ref if the return value indicates preexisting work.

Fixes: cd7eab44e994 ("genirq: Add IRQ affinity notifiers")
Fixes: 59c39840f5ab ("genirq: Prevent use-after-free and work list corruption")
