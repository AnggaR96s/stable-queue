Subject: Revert "USB: serial: ch341: add new Product ID for CH341A"

From: Dmytro Bagrii <dimich.dmb@gmail.com>

commit 198a7ebd5fa17b4d0be8cb70240ee1be885175c0 upstream.

This reverts commit 46ee4abb10a07bd8f8ce910ee6b4ae6a947d7f63.

CH341 has Product ID 0x5512 in EPP/MEM mode which is used for
I2C/SPI/GPIO interfaces. In asynchronous serial interface mode
CH341 has PID 0x5523 which is already in the table.

Mode is selected by corresponding jumper setting.
