Subject: bcache: fix miss key refill->end in writeback

From: Tang Junhui <tang.junhui.linux@gmail.com>

commit 2d6cb6edd2c7fb4f40998895bda45006281b1ac5 upstream.

refill->end record the last key of writeback, for example, at the first
time, keys (1,128K) to (1,1024K) are flush to the backend device, but
the end key (1,1024K) is not included, since the bellow code:
	if (bkey_cmp(k, refill->end) >= 0) {
		ret = MAP_DONE;
		goto out;
	}
And in the next time when we refill writeback keybuf again, we searched
key start from (1,1024K), and got a key bigger than it, so the key
(1,1024K) missed.
This patch modify the above code, and let the end key to be included to
the writeback key buffer.
