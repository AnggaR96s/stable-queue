Subject: ip_tunnel: don't force DF when MTU is locked

From: Sabrina Dubroca <sd@queasysnail.net>

[ Upstream commit 16f7eb2b77b55da816c4e207f3f9440a8cafc00a ]

The various types of tunnels running over IPv4 can ask to set the DF
bit to do PMTU discovery. However, PMTU discovery is subject to the
threshold set by the net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu sysctl, and is also
disabled on routes with "mtu lock". In those cases, we shouldn't set
the DF bit.

This patch makes setting the DF bit conditional on the route's MTU
locking state.

This issue seems to be older than git history.
