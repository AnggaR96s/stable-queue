Subject: net/mlx4_core: Fix wrong calculation of free counters

From: Eran Ben Elisha <eranbe@mellanox.com>

commit 0bb9fc4f5429ac970181c073aa32e521e20f7b73 upstream.

The field res_free indicates the total number of counters which are
available for allocation (reserved and unreserved). Fixed a bug where
the reserved counters were subtracted from res_free before any
allocation was performed.

Before this fix, free counters which were not reserved could not be
allocated.

Fixes: 9de92c60beaa ("net/mlx4_core: Adjust counter grant policy in the resource tracker")
