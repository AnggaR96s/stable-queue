Subject: xhci: Add check for invalid byte size error when UAS devices are connected.

From: Sandeep Singh <sandeep.singh@amd.com>

commit d9193efba84fe4c4aa22a569fade5e6ca971f8af upstream.

Observed "TRB completion code (27)" error which corresponds to Stopped -
Length Invalid error(xhci spec section 4.17.4) while connecting USB to
SATA bridge.

Looks like this case was not considered when the following patch[1] was
committed. Hence adding this new check which can prevent
the invalid byte size error.
