Subject: Tree connect for SMB3.1.1 must be signed for non-encrypted shares

From: Steve French <smfrench@gmail.com>

commit 6188f28bf608ddecc2377663b0f2f709440c19ba upstream.

SMB3.1.1 tree connect was only being signed when signing was mandatory
but needs to always be signed (for non-guest users).

See MS-SMB2 section 3.2.4.1.1
