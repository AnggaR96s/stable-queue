Subject: ALSA: virmidi: Fix too long output trigger loop

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 50e9ffb1996a5d11ff5040a266585bad4ceeca0a upstream.

The virmidi output trigger tries to parse the all available bytes and
process sequencer events as much as possible.  In a normal situation,
this is supposed to be relatively short, but a program may give a huge
buffer and it'll take a long time in a single spin lock, which may
eventually lead to a soft lockup.

This patch simply adds a workaround, a cond_resched() call in the loop
if applicable.  A better solution would be to move the event processor
into a work, but let's put a duct-tape quickly at first.
