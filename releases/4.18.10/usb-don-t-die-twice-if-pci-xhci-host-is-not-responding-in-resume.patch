Subject: usb: Don't die twice if PCI xhci host is not responding in resume

From: Mathias Nyman <mathias.nyman@linux.intel.com>

commit f3dc41c5d22b2ca14a0802a65d8cdc33a3882d4e upstream.

usb_hc_died() should only be called once, and with the primary HCD
as parameter. It will mark both primary and secondary hcd's dead.

Remove the extra call to usb_cd_died with the shared hcd as parameter.

Fixes: ff9d78b36f76 ("USB: Set usb_hcd->state and flags for shared roothubs")
