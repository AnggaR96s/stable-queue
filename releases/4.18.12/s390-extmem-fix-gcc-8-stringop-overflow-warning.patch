Subject: s390/extmem: fix gcc 8 stringop-overflow warning

From: Vasily Gorbik <gor@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit 6b2ddf33baec23dace85bd647e3fc4ac070963e8 ]

arch/s390/mm/extmem.c: In function '__segment_load':
arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:436:2: warning: 'strncat' specified bound 7 equals
source length [-Wstringop-overflow=]
  strncat(seg->res_name, " (DCSS)", 7);

What gcc complains about here is the misuse of strncat function, which
in this case does not limit a number of bytes taken from "src", so it is
in the end the same as strcat(seg->res_name, " (DCSS)");

Keeping in mind that a res_name is 15 bytes, strncat in this case
would overflow the buffer and write 0 into alignment byte between the
fields in the struct. To avoid that increasing res_name size to 16,
and reusing strlcat.
