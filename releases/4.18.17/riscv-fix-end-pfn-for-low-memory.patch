Subject: RISCV: Fix end PFN for low memory

[ Upstream commit ef1f2258748b675422ca0107e5bfb9ceeac675de ]

Use memblock_end_of_DRAM which provides correct last low memory
PFN. Without that, DMA32 region becomes empty resulting in zero
pages being allocated for DMA32.

This patch is based on earlier patch from palmer which never
merged into 4.19. I just edited the commit text to make more
sense.
