Subject: net: hns3: Fix for vf vlan delete failed problem

From: Yunsheng Lin <linyunsheng@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 41dafea2af781d8e3ab8626d236b52e4172905a3 ]

There are only 128 entries in vf vlan table, if user has added
more than 128 vlan, fw will ignore it and disable the vf vlan
table. So when user deletes the vlan entry that has not been
set to vf vlan table, fw will return not found result and driver
treat that as error, which will cause vlan delete failed problem.

This patch fixes it by returning ok when fw returns not found
result.

Fixes: 6c251711b37f ("net: hns3: Disable vf vlan filter when vf vlan table is full")
