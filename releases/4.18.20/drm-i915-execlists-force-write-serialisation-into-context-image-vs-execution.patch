Subject: drm/i915/execlists: Force write serialisation into context image vs execution

From: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>

commit 0a823e8fd4fd67726697854578f3584ee3a49b1d upstream.

Ensure that the writes into the context image are completed prior to the
register mmio to trigger execution. Although previously we were assured
by the SDM that all writes are flushed before an uncached memory
transaction (our mmio write to submit the context to HW for execution),
we have empirical evidence to believe that this is not actually the
case.
