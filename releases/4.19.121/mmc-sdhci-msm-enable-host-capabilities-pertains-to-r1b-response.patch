Subject: mmc: sdhci-msm: Enable host capabilities pertains to R1b response

From: Veerabhadrarao Badiganti <vbadigan@codeaurora.org>

commit 9d8cb58691f85cef687512262acb2c7109ee4868 upstream.

MSM sd host controller is capable of HW busy detection of device busy
signaling over DAT0 line. And it requires the R1B response for commands
that have this response associated with them.

So set the below two host capabilities for qcom SDHC.
 - MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY
 - MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY

Recent development of the mmc core in regards to this, revealed this as
being a potential bug, hence the stable tag.
