Subject: evm: Check also if *tfm is an error pointer in init_desc()

From: Roberto Sassu <roberto.sassu@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 53de3b080d5eae31d0de219617155dcc34e7d698 ]

This patch avoids a kernel panic due to accessing an error pointer set by
crypto_alloc_shash(). It occurs especially when there are many files that
require an unsupported algorithm, as it would increase the likelihood of
the following race condition:

Task A: *tfm = crypto_alloc_shash() <= error pointer
Task B: if (*tfm == NULL) <= *tfm is not NULL, use it
Task B: rc = crypto_shash_init(desc) <= panic
Task A: *tfm = NULL

This patch uses the IS_ERR_OR_NULL macro to determine whether or not a new
crypto context must be created.
