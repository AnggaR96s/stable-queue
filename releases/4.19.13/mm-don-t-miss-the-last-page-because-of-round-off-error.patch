Subject: mm: don't miss the last page because of round-off error

From: Roman Gushchin <guro@fb.com>

commit 68600f623d69da428c6163275f97ca126e1a8ec5 upstream.

I've noticed, that dying memory cgroups are often pinned in memory by a
single pagecache page.  Even under moderate memory pressure they sometimes
stayed in such state for a long time.  That looked strange.

My investigation showed that the problem is caused by applying the LRU
pressure balancing math:

  scan = div64_u64(scan * fraction[lru], denominator),

where

  denominator = fraction[anon] + fraction[file] + 1.

Because fraction[lru] is always less than denominator, if the initial scan
size is 1, the result is always 0.

This means the last page is not scanned and has
no chances to be reclaimed.

Fix this by rounding up the result of the division.

In practice this change significantly improves the speed of dying cgroups
reclaim.
