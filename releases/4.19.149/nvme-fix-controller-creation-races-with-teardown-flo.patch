Subject: nvme: Fix controller creation races with teardown flow

From: Israel Rukshin <israelr@mellanox.com>

[ Upstream commit ce1518139e6976cf19c133b555083354fdb629b8 ]

Calling nvme_sysfs_delete() when the controller is in the middle of
creation may cause several bugs. If the controller is in NEW state we
remove delete_controller file and don't delete the controller. The user
will not be able to use nvme disconnect command on that controller again,
although the controller may be active. Other bugs may happen if the
controller is in the middle of create_ctrl callback and
nvme_do_delete_ctrl() starts. For example, freeing I/O tagset at
nvme_do_delete_ctrl() before it was allocated at create_ctrl callback.

To fix all those races don't allow the user to delete the controller
before it was fully created.
