Subject: drivers/net/wan/hdlc: Set skb->protocol before transmitting

From: Xie He <xie.he.0141@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 9fb030a70431a2a2a1b292dbf0b2f399cc072c16 ]

This patch sets skb->protocol before transmitting frames on the HDLC
device, so that a user listening on the HDLC device with an AF_PACKET
socket will see outgoing frames' sll_protocol field correctly set and
consistent with that of incoming frames.

1. Control frames in hdlc_cisco and hdlc_ppp

When these drivers send control frames, skb->protocol is not set.

This value should be set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC), because when receiving
control frames, their skb->protocol is set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC).

When receiving, hdlc_type_trans in hdlc.h is called, which then calls
cisco_type_trans or ppp_type_trans. The skb->protocol of control frames
is set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC) so that the control frames can be received
by hdlc_rcv in hdlc.c, which calls cisco_rx or ppp_rx to process the
control frames.

2. hdlc_fr

When this driver sends control frames, skb->protocol is set to internal
values used in this driver.

When this driver sends data frames (from upper stacked PVC devices),
skb->protocol is the same as that of the user data packet being sent on
the upper PVC device (for normal PVC devices), or is htons(ETH_P_802_3)
(for Ethernet-emulating PVC devices).

However, skb->protocol for both control frames and data frames should be
set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC), because when receiving, all frames received on
the HDLC device will have their skb->protocol set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC).

When receiving, hdlc_type_trans in hdlc.h is called, and because this
driver doesn't provide a type_trans function in struct hdlc_proto,
all frames will have their skb->protocol set to htons(ETH_P_HDLC).
The frames are then received by hdlc_rcv in hdlc.c, which calls fr_rx
to process the frames (control frames are consumed and data frames
are re-received on upper PVC devices).
