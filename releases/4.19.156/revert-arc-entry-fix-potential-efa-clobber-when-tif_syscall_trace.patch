This reverts commit 00fdec98d9881bf5173af09aebd353ab3b9ac729.
(but only from 5.2 and prior kernels)

The original commit was a preventive fix based on code-review and was
auto-picked for stable back-port (for better or worse).
It was OK for v5.3+ kernels, but turned up needing an implicit change
68e5c6f073bcf70 "(ARC: entry: EV_Trap expects r10 (vs. r9) to have
 exception cause)" merged in v5.3 which itself was not backported.
So to summarize the stable backport of this patch for v5.2 and prior
kernels is busted and it won't boot.

The obvious solution is backport 68e5c6f073bcf70 but that is a pain as
it doesn't revert cleanly and each of affected kernels (so far v4.19,
v4.14, v4.9, v4.4) needs a slightly different massaged varaint.
So the easier fix is to simply revert the backport from 5.2 and prior.
The issue was not a big deal as it would cause strace to sporadically
not work correctly.

Waldemar Brodkorb first reported this when running ARC uClibc regressions
on latest stable kernels (with offending backport). Once he bisected it,
the analysis was trivial, so thx to him for this.
