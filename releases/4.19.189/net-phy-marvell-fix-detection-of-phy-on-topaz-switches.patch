Subject: net: phy: marvell: fix detection of PHY on Topaz switches

From: Pali Rohár <pali@kernel.org>

commit 1fe976d308acb6374c899a4ee8025a0a016e453e upstream.

Since commit fee2d546414d ("net: phy: marvell: mv88e6390 temperature
sensor reading"), Linux reports the temperature of Topaz hwmon as
constant -75°C.

This is because switches from the Topaz family (88E6141 / 88E6341) have
the address of the temperature sensor register different from Peridot.

This address is instead compatible with 88E1510 PHYs, as was used for
Topaz before the above mentioned commit.

Create a new mapping table between switch family and PHY ID for families
which don't have a model number. And define PHY IDs for Topaz and Peridot
families.

Create a new PHY ID and a new PHY driver for Topaz's internal PHY.
The only difference from Peridot's PHY driver is the HWMON probing
method.

Prior this change Topaz's internal PHY is detected by kernel as:

  PHY [...] driver [Marvell 88E6390] (irq=63)

And afterwards as:

  PHY [...] driver [Marvell 88E6341 Family] (irq=63)
