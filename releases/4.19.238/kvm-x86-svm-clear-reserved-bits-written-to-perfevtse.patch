Subject: KVM: x86/svm: Clear reserved bits written to PerfEvtSeln MSRs

From: Jim Mattson <jmattson@google.com>

[ Upstream commit 9b026073db2f1ad0e4d8b61c83316c8497981037 ]

AMD EPYC CPUs never raise a #GP for a WRMSR to a PerfEvtSeln MSR. Some
reserved bits are cleared, and some are not. Specifically, on
Zen3/Milan, bits 19 and 42 are not cleared.

When emulating such a WRMSR, KVM should not synthesize a #GP,
regardless of which bits are set. However, undocumented bits should
not be passed through to the hardware MSR. So, rather than checking
for reserved bits and synthesizing a #GP, just clear the reserved
bits.

This may seem pedantic, but since KVM currently does not support the
"Host/Guest Only" bits (41:40), it is necessary to clear these bits
rather than synthesizing #GP, because some popular guests (e.g Linux)
will set the "Host Only" bit even on CPUs that don't support
EFER.SVME, and they don't expect a #GP.

For example,

root@Ubuntu1804:~# perf stat -e r26 -a sleep 1

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

                 0      r26
