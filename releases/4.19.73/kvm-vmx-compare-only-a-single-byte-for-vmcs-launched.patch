Subject: KVM: VMX: Compare only a single byte for VMCS' "launched" in vCPU-run

[ Upstream commit 61c08aa9606d4e48a8a50639c956448a720174c3 ]

The vCPU-run asm blob does a manual comparison of a VMCS' launched
status to execute the correct VM-Enter instruction, i.e. VMLAUNCH vs.
VMRESUME.  The launched flag is a bool, which is a typedef of _Bool.
C99 does not define an exact size for _Bool, stating only that is must
be large enough to hold '0' and '1'.  Most, if not all, compilers use
a single byte for _Bool, including gcc[1].

Originally, 'launched' was of type 'int' and so the asm blob used 'cmpl'
to check the launch status.  When 'launched' was moved to be stored on a
per-VMCS basis, struct vcpu_vmx's "temporary" __launched flag was added
in order to avoid having to pass the current VMCS into the asm blob.
The new  '__launched' was defined as a 'bool' and not an 'int', but the
'cmp' instruction was not updated.

This has not caused any known problems, likely due to compilers aligning
variables to 4-byte or 8-byte boundaries and KVM zeroing out struct
vcpu_vmx during allocation.  I.e. vCPU-run accesses "junk" data, it just
happens to always be zero and so doesn't affect the result.
