Subject: net: gso: Fix skb_segment splat when splitting gso_size mangled skb having linear-headed frag_list

From: Shmulik Ladkani <shmulik@metanetworks.com>

[ Upstream commit 3dcbdb134f329842a38f0e6797191b885ab00a00 ]

Historically, support for frag_list packets entering skb_segment() was
limited to frag_list members terminating on exact same gso_size
boundaries. This is verified with a BUG_ON since commit 89319d3801d1
("net: Add frag_list support to skb_segment"), quote:

    As such we require all frag_list members terminate on exact MSS
    boundaries.  This is checked using BUG_ON.
    As there should only be one producer in the kernel of such packets,
    namely GRO, this requirement should not be difficult to maintain.

However, since commit 6578171a7ff0 ("bpf: add bpf_skb_change_proto helper"),
the "exact MSS boundaries" assumption no longer holds:
An eBPF program using bpf_skb_change_proto() DOES modify 'gso_size', but
leaves the frag_list members as originally merged by GRO with the
original 'gso_size'. Example of such programs are bpf-based NAT46 or
NAT64.

This lead to a kernel BUG_ON for flows involving:
 - GRO generating a frag_list skb
 - bpf program performing bpf_skb_change_proto() or bpf_skb_adjust_room()
 - skb_segment() of the skb

See example BUG_ON reports in [0].

In commit 13acc94eff12 ("net: permit skb_segment on head_frag frag_list skb"),
skb_segment() was modified to support the "gso_size mangling" case of
a frag_list GRO'ed skb, but *only* for frag_list members having
head_frag==true (having a page-fragment head).

Alas, GRO packets having frag_list members with a linear kmalloced head
(head_frag==false) still hit the BUG_ON.

This commit adds support to skb_segment() for a 'head_skb' packet having
a frag_list whose members are *non* head_frag, with gso_size mangled, by
disabling SG and thus falling-back to copying the data from the given
'head_skb' into the generated segmented skbs - as suggested by Willem de
Bruijn [1].

Since this approach involves the penalty of skb_copy_and_csum_bits()
when building the segments, care was taken in order to enable this
solution only when required:
 - untrusted gso_size, by testing SKB_GSO_DODGY is set
   (SKB_GSO_DODGY is set by any gso_size mangling functions in
    net/core/filter.c)
 - the frag_list is non empty, its item is a non head_frag, *and* the
   headlen of the given 'head_skb' does not match the gso_size.
