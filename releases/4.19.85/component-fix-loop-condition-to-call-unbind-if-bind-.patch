Subject: component: fix loop condition to call unbind() if bind() fails

From: Banajit Goswami <bgoswami@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit bdae566d5d9733b6e32b378668b84eadf28a94d4 ]

During component_bind_all(), if bind() fails for any
particular component associated with a master, unbind()
should be called for all previous components in that
master's match array, whose bind() might have completed
successfully. As per the current logic, if bind() fails
for the component at position 'n' in the master's match
array, it would start calling unbind() from component in
'n'th position itself and work backwards, and will always
skip calling unbind() for component in 0th position in the
master's match array.
Fix this by updating the loop condition, and the logic to
refer to the components in master's match array, so that
unbind() is called for all components starting from 'n-1'st
position in the array, until (and including) component in
0th position.
