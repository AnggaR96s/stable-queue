Subject: arm64: psci: Reduce the waiting time for cpu_psci_cpu_kill()

From: Yunfeng Ye <yeyunfeng@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit bfcef4ab1d7ee8921bc322109b1692036cc6cbe0 ]

In cases like suspend-to-disk and suspend-to-ram, a large number of CPU
cores need to be shut down. At present, the CPU hotplug operation is
serialised, and the CPU cores can only be shut down one by one. In this
process, if PSCI affinity_info() does not return LEVEL_OFF quickly,
cpu_psci_cpu_kill() needs to wait for 10ms. If hundreds of CPU cores
need to be shut down, it will take a long time.

Normally, there is no need to wait 10ms in cpu_psci_cpu_kill(). So
change the wait interval from 10 ms to max 1 ms and use usleep_range()
instead of msleep() for more accurate timer.

In addition, reducing the time interval will increase the messages
output, so remove the "Retry ..." message, instead, track time and
output to the the sucessful message.
