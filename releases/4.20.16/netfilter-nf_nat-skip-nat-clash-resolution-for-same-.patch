Subject: netfilter: nf_nat: skip nat clash resolution for same-origin entries

[ Upstream commit 4e35c1cb9460240e983a01745b5f29fe3a4d8e39 ]

It is possible that two concurrent packets originating from the same
socket of a connection-less protocol (e.g. UDP) can end up having
different IP_CT_DIR_REPLY tuples which results in one of the packets
being dropped.

To illustrate this, consider the following simplified scenario:

1. Packet A and B are sent at the same time from two different threads
   by same UDP socket.  No matching conntrack entry exists yet.
   Both packets cause allocation of a new conntrack entry.
2. get_unique_tuple gets called for A.  No clashing entry found.
   conntrack entry for A is added to main conntrack table.
3. get_unique_tuple is called for B and will find that the reply
   tuple of B is already taken by A.
   It will allocate a new UDP source port for B to resolve the clash.
4. conntrack entry for B cannot be added to main conntrack table
   because its ORIGINAL direction is clashing with A and the REPLY
   directions of A and B are not the same anymore due to UDP source
   port reallocation done in step 3.

This patch modifies nf_conntrack_tuple_taken so it doesn't consider
colliding reply tuples if the IP_CT_DIR_ORIGINAL tuples are equal.

[ Florian: simplify patch to not use .allow_clash setting
  and always ignore identical flows ]
