Subject: mm: hugetlb: call huge_pte_alloc() only if ptep is null

From: Naoya Horiguchi <n-horiguchi@ah.jp.nec.com>

commit 0d777df5d8953293be090d9ab5a355db893e8357 upstream.

Currently at the beginning of hugetlb_fault(), we call huge_pte_offset()
and check whether the obtained *ptep is a migration/hwpoison entry or
not.  And if not, then we get to call huge_pte_alloc().  This is racy
because the *ptep could turn into migration/hwpoison entry after the
huge_pte_offset() check.  This race results in BUG_ON in
huge_pte_alloc().

We don't have to call huge_pte_alloc() when the huge_pte_offset()
returns non-NULL, so let's fix this bug with moving the code into else
block.

Note that the *ptep could turn into a migration/hwpoison entry after
this block, but that's not a problem because we have another
!pte_present check later (we never go into hugetlb_no_page() in that
case.)
