Subject: eventpoll.h: add missing epoll event masks

From: Greg KH <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

commit 7e040726850a106587485c21bdacc0bfc8a0cbed upstream.

[resend due to me forgetting to cc: linux-api the first time around I
posted these back on Feb 23]

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

For some reason these values are not in the uapi header file, so any
libc has to define it themselves.  To prevent them from needing to do
this, just have the kernel provide the correct values.
