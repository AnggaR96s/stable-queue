Subject: arm64: cpuinfo: Missing NULL terminator in compat_hwcap_str

From: Julien Grall <julien.grall@arm.com>

commit f228b494e56d949be8d8ea09d4f973d1979201bf upstream.

The loop that browses the array compat_hwcap_str will stop when a NULL
is encountered, however NULL is missing at the end of array. This will
lead to overrun until a NULL is found somewhere in the following memory.
In reality, this works out because the compat_hwcap2_str array tends to
follow immediately in memory, and that *is* terminated correctly.
Furthermore, the unsigned int compat_elf_hwcap is checked before
printing each capability, so we end up doing the right thing because
the size of the two arrays is less than 32. Still, this is an obvious
mistake and should be fixed.

Note for backporting: commit 12d11817eaafa414 ("arm64: Move
/proc/cpuinfo handling code") moved this code in v4.4. Prior to that
commit, the same change should be made in arch/arm64/kernel/setup.c.
