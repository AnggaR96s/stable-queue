Subject: fix io_destroy()/aio_complete() race

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

commit 4faa99965e027cc057c5145ce45fa772caa04e8d upstream.

If io_destroy() gets to cancelling everything that can be cancelled and
gets to kiocb_cancel() calling the function driver has left in ->ki_cancel,
it becomes vulnerable to a race with IO completion.  At that point req
is already taken off the list and aio_complete() does *NOT* spin until
we (in free_ioctx_users()) releases ->ctx_lock.  As the result, it proceeds
to kiocb_free(), freing req just it gets passed to ->ki_cancel().

Fix is simple - remove from the list after the call of kiocb_cancel().  All
instances of ->ki_cancel() already have to cope with the being called with
iocb still on list - that's what happens in io_cancel(2).
