Subject: fix __legitimize_mnt()/mntput() race

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

commit 119e1ef80ecfe0d1deb6378d4ab41f5b71519de1 upstream.

__legitimize_mnt() has two problems - one is that in case of success
the check of mount_lock is not ordered wrt preceding increment of
refcount, making it possible to have successful __legitimize_mnt()
on one CPU just before the otherwise final mntpu() on another,
with __legitimize_mnt() not seeing mntput() taking the lock and
mntput() not seeing the increment done by __legitimize_mnt().
Solved by a pair of barriers.

Another is that failure of __legitimize_mnt() on the second
read_seqretry() leaves us with reference that'll need to be
dropped by caller; however, if that races with final mntput()
we can end up with caller dropping rcu_read_lock() and doing
mntput() to release that reference - with the first mntput()
having freed the damn thing just as rcu_read_lock() had been
dropped.  Solution: in "do mntput() yourself" failure case
grab mount_lock, check if MNT_DOOMED has been set by racing
final mntput() that has missed our increment and if it has -
undo the increment and treat that as "failure, caller doesn't
need to drop anything" case.

It's not easy to hit - the final mntput() has to come right
after the first read_seqretry() in __legitimize_mnt() *and*
manage to miss the increment done by __legitimize_mnt() before
the second read_seqretry() in there.  The things that are almost
impossible to hit on bare hardware are not impossible on SMP
KVM, though...
