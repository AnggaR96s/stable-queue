Subject: make nfs_atomic_open() call d_drop() on all ->open_context() errors.

From: Al Viro <viro@ZenIV.linux.org.uk>

commit d20cb71dbf3487f24549ede1a8e2d67579b4632e upstream.

In "NFSv4: Move dentry instantiation into the NFSv4-specific atomic open code"
unconditional d_drop() after the ->open_context() had been removed.  It had
been correct for success cases (there ->open_context() itself had been doing
dcache manipulations), but not for error ones.  Only one of those (ENOENT)
got a compensatory d_drop() added in that commit, but in fact it should've
been done for all errors.  As it is, the case of O_CREAT non-exclusive open
on a hashed negative dentry racing with e.g. symlink creation from another
client ended up with ->open_context() getting an error and proceeding to
call nfs_lookup().  On a hashed dentry, which would've instantly triggered
BUG_ON() in d_materialise_unique() (or, these days, its equivalent in
d_splice_alias()).
