Subject: tracing: Skip more functions when doing stack tracing of events

[ Upstream commit be54f69c26193de31053190761e521903b89d098 ]

 # echo 1 > options/stacktrace
 # echo 1 > events/sched/sched_switch/enable
 # cat trace
          <idle>-0     [002] d..2  1982.525169: <stack trace>
 => save_stack_trace
 => __ftrace_trace_stack
 => trace_buffer_unlock_commit_regs
 => event_trigger_unlock_commit
 => trace_event_buffer_commit
 => trace_event_raw_event_sched_switch
 => __schedule
 => schedule
 => schedule_preempt_disabled
 => cpu_startup_entry
 => start_secondary

The above shows that we are seeing 6 functions before ever making it to the
caller of the sched_switch event.

 # echo stacktrace > events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
 # cat trace
          <idle>-0     [002] d..3  2146.335208: <stack trace>
 => trace_event_buffer_commit
 => trace_event_raw_event_sched_switch
 => __schedule
 => schedule
 => schedule_preempt_disabled
 => cpu_startup_entry
 => start_secondary

The stacktrace trigger isn't as bad, because it adds its own skip to the
stacktracing, but still has two events extra.

One issue is that if the stacktrace passes its own "regs" then there should
be no addition to the skip, as the regs will not include the functions being
called. This was an issue that was fixed by commit 7717c6be6999 ("tracing:
Fix stacktrace skip depth in trace_buffer_unlock_commit_regs()" as adding
the skip number for kprobes made the probes not have any stack at all.

But since this is only an issue when regs is being used, a skip should be
added if regs is NULL. Now we have:

 # echo 1 > options/stacktrace
 # echo 1 > events/sched/sched_switch/enable
 # cat trace
          <idle>-0     [000] d..2  1297.676333: <stack trace>
 => __schedule
 => schedule
 => schedule_preempt_disabled
 => cpu_startup_entry
 => rest_init
 => start_kernel
 => x86_64_start_reservations
 => x86_64_start_kernel

 # echo stacktrace > events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
 # cat trace
          <idle>-0     [002] d..3  1370.759745: <stack trace>
 => __schedule
 => schedule
 => schedule_preempt_disabled
 => cpu_startup_entry
 => start_secondary

And kprobes are not touched.
