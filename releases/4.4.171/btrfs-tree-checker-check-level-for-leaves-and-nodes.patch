Subject: btrfs: tree-checker: Check level for leaves and nodes

From: Qu Wenruo <wqu@suse.com>

commit f556faa46eb4e96d0d0772e74ecf66781e132f72 upstream.

Although we have tree level check at tree read runtime, it's completely
based on its parent level.
We still need to do accurate level check to avoid invalid tree blocks
sneak into kernel space.

The check itself is simple, for leaf its level should always be 0.
For nodes its level should be in range [1, BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL - 1].

[bwh: Backported to 4.4:
 - Pass root instead of fs_info to generic_err()
 - Adjust context]
