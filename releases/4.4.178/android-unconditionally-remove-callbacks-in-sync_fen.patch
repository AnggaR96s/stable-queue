Subject: android: unconditionally remove callbacks in sync_fence_free()

[ Upstream commit 699f685569434510d944e419f4048c4e3ba8d631 ]

Using fence->status to determine whether or not there are callbacks
remaining on the sync_fence is racy since fence->status may have been
decremented to 0 on another CPU before fence_check_cb_func() has
completed.  By unconditionally calling fence_remove_callback() for each
fence in the sync_fence, we guarantee that each callback has either
completed (since fence_remove_callback() grabs the fence lock) or been
removed.
