Subject: stm class: Fix channel free in stm output free path

From: Tingwei Zhang <tingwei@codeaurora.org>

commit ee496da4c3915de3232b5f5cd20e21ae3e46fe8d upstream.

Number of free masters is not set correctly in stm
free path. Fix this by properly adding the number
of output channels before setting them to 0 in
stm_output_disclaim().

Currently it is equivalent to doing nothing since
master->nr_free is incremented by 0.

Fixes: 7bd1d4093c2f ("stm class: Introduce an abstraction for System Trace Module devices")
