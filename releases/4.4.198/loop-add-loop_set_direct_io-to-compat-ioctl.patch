Subject: loop: Add LOOP_SET_DIRECT_IO to compat ioctl

From: Alessio Balsini <balsini@android.com>

[ Upstream commit fdbe4eeeb1aac219b14f10c0ed31ae5d1123e9b8 ]

Enabling Direct I/O with loop devices helps reducing memory usage by
avoiding double caching.  32 bit applications running on 64 bits systems
are currently not able to request direct I/O because is missing from the
lo_compat_ioctl.

This patch fixes the compatibility issue mentioned above by exporting
LOOP_SET_DIRECT_IO as additional lo_compat_ioctl() entry.
The input argument for this ioctl is a single long converted to a 1-bit
boolean, so compatibility is preserved.
