Subject: usb: hub: Fix unbalanced reference count/memory leak/deadlocks

From: Viresh Kumar <viresh.kumar@linaro.org>

commit 6bb47e8ab98accb1319bd43c64966340ba3bba9a upstream.

Memory leak and unbalanced reference count:

If the hub gets disconnected while the core is still activating it, this
can result in leaking memory of few USB structures.

This will happen if we have done a kref_get() from hub_activate() and
scheduled a delayed work item for HUB_INIT2/3. Now if hub_disconnect()
gets called before the delayed work expires, then we will cancel the
work from hub_quiesce(), but wouldn't do a kref_put(). And so the
unbalance.

kmemleak reports this as (with the commit e50293ef9775 backported to
3.10 kernel with other changes, though the same is true for mainline as
well):

unreferenced object 0xffffffc08af5b800 (size 1024):

Deadlocks:

If the hub gets disconnected early enough (i.e. before INIT2/INIT3 are
finished and the init_work is still queued), the core may call
hub_quiesce() after acquiring interface device locks and it will wait
for the work to be cancelled synchronously. But if the work handler is
already running in parallel, it may try to acquire the same interface
device lock and this may result in deadlock.

Fix both the issues by removing the call to cancel_delayed_work_sync().
