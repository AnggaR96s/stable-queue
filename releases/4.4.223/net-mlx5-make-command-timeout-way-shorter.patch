Subject: net/mlx5: Make command timeout way shorter

From: Or Gerlitz <ogerlitz@mellanox.com>

commit 6b6c07bdcdc97ccac2596063bfc32a5faddfe884 upstream.

The command timeout is terribly long, whole two hours. Make it 60s so if
things do go wrong, the user gets feedback in relatively short time, so
they can take corrective actions and/or investigate using tools and such.

Fixes: e126ba97dba9 ('mlx5: Add driver for Mellanox Connect-IB adapters')
