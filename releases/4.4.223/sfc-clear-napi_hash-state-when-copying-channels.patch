Subject: sfc: clear napi_hash state when copying channels

From: Bert Kenward <bkenward@solarflare.com>

commit 46d054f8f540612f09987a53154aa39ae15f2e4c upstream.

efx_copy_channel() doesn't correctly clear the napi_hash related state.
This means that when napi_hash_add is called for that channel nothing is
done, and we are left with a copy of the napi_hash_node from the old
channel. When we later call napi_hash_del() on this channel we have a
stale napi_hash_node.

Corruption is only seen when there are multiple entries in one of the
napi_hash lists. This is made more likely by having a very large number
of channels. Testing was carried out with 512 channels - 32 channels on
each of 16 ports.

This failure typically appears as protection faults within napi_by_id()
or napi_hash_add(). efx_copy_channel() is only used when tx or rx ring
sizes are changed (ethtool -G).
