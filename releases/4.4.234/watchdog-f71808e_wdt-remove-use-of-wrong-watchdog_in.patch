Subject: watchdog: f71808e_wdt: remove use of wrong watchdog_info option

From: Ahmad Fatoum <a.fatoum@pengutronix.de>

[ Upstream commit 802141462d844f2e6a4d63a12260d79b7afc4c34 ]

The flags that should be or-ed into the watchdog_info.options by drivers
all start with WDIOF_, e.g. WDIOF_SETTIMEOUT, which indicates that the
driver's watchdog_ops has a usable set_timeout.

WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT was used instead, which expands to 0xc0045706, which
equals:

   WDIOF_FANFAULT | WDIOF_EXTERN1 | WDIOF_PRETIMEOUT | WDIOF_ALARMONLY |
   WDIOF_MAGICCLOSE | 0xc0045000

These were so far indicated to userspace on WDIOC_GETSUPPORT.
As the driver has not yet been migrated to the new watchdog kernel API,
the constant can just be dropped without substitute.
