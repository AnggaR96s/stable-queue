Subject: futex: Replace PF_EXITPIDONE with a state
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Cc: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>, Ingo Molnar <mingo@kernel.org>, Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>, Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>, Lee Jones <lee.jones@linaro.org>
Message-ID: <20210201151214.2193508-4-lee.jones@linaro.org>

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit 3d4775df0a89240f671861c6ab6e8d59af8e9e41 upstream.

The futex exit handling relies on PF_ flags. That's suboptimal as it
requires a smp_mb() and an ugly lock/unlock of the exiting tasks pi_lock in
the middle of do_exit() to enforce the observability of PF_EXITING in the
futex code.

Add a futex_state member to task_struct and convert the PF_EXITPIDONE logic
over to the new state. The PF_EXITING dependency will be cleaned up in a
later step.

This prepares for handling various futex exit issues later.
