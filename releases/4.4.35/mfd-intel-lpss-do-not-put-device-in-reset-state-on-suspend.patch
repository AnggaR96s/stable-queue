Subject: mfd: intel-lpss: Do not put device in reset state on suspend

From: Azhar Shaikh <azhar.shaikh@intel.com>

commit 274e43edcda6f709aa67e436b3123e45a6270923 upstream.

Commit 41a3da2b8e163 ("mfd: intel-lpss: Save register context on
suspend") saved the register context while going to suspend and
also put the device in reset state.

Due to the resetting of device, system cannot enter S3/S0ix
states when no_console_suspend flag is enabled. The system
and serial console both hang. The resetting of device is not
needed while going to suspend. Hence remove this code.
