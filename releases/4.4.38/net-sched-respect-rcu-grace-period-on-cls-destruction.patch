Subject: net, sched: respect rcu grace period on cls destruction

From: Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>


[ Upstream commit d936377414fadbafb4d17148d222fe45ca5442d4 ]

Roi reported a crash in flower where tp->root was NULL in ->classify()
callbacks. Reason is that in ->destroy() tp->root is set to NULL via
RCU_INIT_POINTER(). It's problematic for some of the classifiers, because
this doesn't respect RCU grace period for them, and as a result, still
outstanding readers from tc_classify() will try to blindly dereference
a NULL tp->root.

The tp->root object is strictly private to the classifier implementation
and holds internal data the core such as tc_ctl_tfilter() doesn't know
about. Within some classifiers, such as cls_bpf, cls_basic, etc, tp->root
is only checked for NULL in ->get() callback, but nowhere else. This is
misleading and seemed to be copied from old classifier code that was not
cleaned up properly. For example, d3fa76ee6b4a ("[NET_SCHED]: cls_basic:
fix NULL pointer dereference") moved tp->root initialization into ->init()
routine, where before it was part of ->change(), so ->get() had to deal
with tp->root being NULL back then, so that was indeed a valid case, after
d3fa76ee6b4a, not really anymore. We used to set tp->root to NULL long
ago in ->destroy(), see 47a1a1d4be29 ("pkt_sched: remove unnecessary xchg()
in packet classifiers"); but the NULLifying was reintroduced with the
RCUification, but it's not correct for every classifier implementation.

In the cases that are fixed here with one exception of cls_cgroup, tp->root
object is allocated and initialized inside ->init() callback, which is always
performed at a point in time after we allocate a new tp, which means tp and
thus tp->root was not globally visible in the tp chain yet (see tc_ctl_tfilter()).
Also, on destruction tp->root is strictly kfree_rcu()'ed in ->destroy()
handler, same for the tp which is kfree_rcu()'ed right when we return
from ->destroy() in tcf_destroy(). This means, the head object's lifetime
for such classifiers is always tied to the tp lifetime. The RCU callback
invocation for the two kfree_rcu() could be out of order, but that's fine
since both are independent.

Dropping the RCU_INIT_POINTER(tp->root, NULL) for these classifiers here
means that 1) we don't need a useless NULL check in fast-path and, 2) that
outstanding readers of that tp in tc_classify() can still execute under
respect with RCU grace period as it is actually expected.

Things that haven't been touched here: cls_fw and cls_route. They each
handle tp->root being NULL in ->classify() path for historic reasons, so
their ->destroy() implementation can stay as is. If someone actually
cares, they could get cleaned up at some point to avoid the test in fast
path. cls_u32 doesn't set tp->root to NULL. For cls_rsvp, I just added a
!head should anyone actually be using/testing it, so it at least aligns with
cls_fw and cls_route. For cls_flower we additionally need to defer rhashtable
destruction (to a sleepable context) after RCU grace period as concurrent
readers might still access it. (Note that in this case we need to hold module
reference to keep work callback address intact, since we only wait on module
unload for all call_rcu()s to finish.)

This fixes one race to bring RCU grace period guarantees back. Next step
as worked on by Cong however is to fix 1e052be69d04 ("net_sched: destroy
proto tp when all filters are gone") to get the order of unlinking the tp
in tc_ctl_tfilter() for the RTM_DELTFILTER case right by moving
RCU_INIT_POINTER() before tcf_destroy() and let the notification for
removal be done through the prior ->delete() callback. Both are independant
issues. Once we have that right, we can then clean tp->root up for a number
of classifiers by not making them RCU pointers, which requires a new callback
(->uninit) that is triggered from tp's RCU callback, where we just kfree()
tp->root from there.
