Subject: drm/i915: Restore inhibiting the load of the default context

From: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>

commit 06ef83a705a98da63797a5a570220b6ca36febd4 upstream.

Following a GPU reset, we may leave the context in a poorly defined
state, and reloading from that context will leave the GPU flummoxed. For
secondary contexts, this will lead to that context being banned - but
currently it is also causing the default context to become banned,
leading to turmoil in the shared state.

This is a regression from

commit 6702cf16e0ba8b0129f5aa1b6609d4e9c70bc13b [v4.1]
Author: Ben Widawsky <benjamin.widawsky@intel.com>
Date:   Mon Mar 16 16:00:58 2015 +0000

    drm/i915: Initialize all contexts

which quietly introduced the removal of the MI_RESTORE_INHIBIT on the
default context.

v2: Mark the global default context as uninitialized on GPU reset so
that the context-local workarounds are reloaded upon re-enabling.

[danvet: This seems to fix a gpu hand on after the first resume,
resulting in any future suspend operation failing with -EIO because
the gpu seems to be in a funky state. Somehow this patch fixes that.]
