Subject: of/irq: Fix msi-map calculation for nonzero rid-base

From: Robin Murphy <robin.murphy@arm.com>

commit 5d589d81acf974d23af98044aac56c6339d659f8 upstream.

The existing msi-map code is fine for shifting the entire RID space
upwards, but attempting finer-grained remapping reveals a bug. It turns
out that we are mistakenly treating the msi-base part as an offset, not
as a new base to remap onto, so things get squiffy when rid-base is
nonzero. Fix this, and at the same time add a sanity check against
having msi-map-mask clash with a nonzero rid-base, as that's another
thing one can easily get wrong.
