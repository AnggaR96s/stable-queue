Subject: usb: dwc3: Fix assignment of EP transfer resources

From: John Youn <John.Youn@synopsys.com>

commit c450960187f45d4260db87c7dd4fc0bceb5565d8 upstream.

The assignement of EP transfer resources was not handled properly in the
dwc3 driver. Commit aebda6187181 ("usb: dwc3: Reset the transfer
resource index on SET_INTERFACE") previously fixed one aspect of this
where resources may be exhausted with multiple calls to SET_INTERFACE.
However, it introduced an issue where composite devices with multiple
interfaces can be assigned the same transfer resources for different
endpoints. This patch solves both issues.

The assignment of transfer resources cannot perfectly follow the data
book due to the fact that the controller driver does not have all
knowledge of the configuration in advance. It is given this information
piecemeal by the composite gadget framework after every
SET_CONFIGURATION and SET_INTERFACE. Trying to follow the databook
programming model in this scenario can cause errors. For two reasons:

1) The databook says to do DEPSTARTCFG for every SET_CONFIGURATION and
SET_INTERFACE (8.1.5). This is incorrect in the scenario of multiple
interfaces.

2) The databook does not mention doing more DEPXFERCFG for new endpoint
on alt setting (8.1.6).

The following simplified method is used instead:

All hardware endpoints can be assigned a transfer resource and this
setting will stay persistent until either a core reset or hibernation.
So whenever we do a DEPSTARTCFG(0) we can go ahead and do DEPXFERCFG for
every hardware endpoint as well. We are guaranteed that there are as
many transfer resources as endpoints.

This patch triggers off of the calling dwc3_gadget_start_config() for
EP0-out, which always happens first, and which should only happen in one
of the above conditions.
