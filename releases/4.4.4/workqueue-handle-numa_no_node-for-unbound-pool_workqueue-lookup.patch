Subject: workqueue: handle NUMA_NO_NODE for unbound pool_workqueue lookup

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit d6e022f1d207a161cd88e08ef0371554680ffc46 upstream.

When looking up the pool_workqueue to use for an unbound workqueue,
workqueue assumes that the target CPU is always bound to a valid NUMA
node.  However, currently, when a CPU goes offline, the mapping is
destroyed and cpu_to_node() returns NUMA_NO_NODE.

This has always been broken but hasn't triggered often enough before
874bbfe600a6 ("workqueue: make sure delayed work run in local cpu").
After the commit, workqueue forcifully assigns the local CPU for
delayed work items without explicit target CPU to fix a different
issue.  This widens the window where CPU can go offline while a
delayed work item is pending causing delayed work items dispatched
with target CPU set to an already offlined CPU.  The resulting
NUMA_NO_NODE mapping makes workqueue try to queue the work item on a
NULL pool_workqueue and thus crash.

While 874bbfe600a6 has been reverted for a different reason making the
bug less visible again, it can still happen.  Fix it by mapping
NUMA_NO_NODE to the default pool_workqueue from unbound_pwq_by_node().
This is a temporary workaround.  The long term solution is keeping CPU
-> NODE mapping stable across CPU off/online cycles which is being
worked on.
