Subject: target: Fix compare_and_write_callback handling for non GOOD status

From: Nicholas Bellinger <nab@linux-iscsi.org>

commit a71a5dc7f833943998e97ca8fa6a4c708a0ed1a9 upstream.

Following the bugfix for handling non SAM_STAT_GOOD COMPARE_AND_WRITE
status during COMMIT phase in commit 9b2792c3da1, the same bug exists
for the READ phase as well.

This would manifest first as a lost SCSI response, and eventual
hung task during fabric driver logout or re-login, as existing
shutdown logic waited for the COMPARE_AND_WRITE se_cmd->cmd_kref
to reach zero.

To address this bug, compare_and_write_callback() has been changed
to set post_ret = 1 and return TCM_LOGICAL_UNIT_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
as necessary to signal failure status.
