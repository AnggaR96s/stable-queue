Subject: md/raid5: preserve STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE in break_stripe_batch_list

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.com>

commit 550da24f8d62fe81f3c13e3ec27602d6e44d43dc upstream.

break_stripe_batch_list breaks up a batch and copies some flags from
the batch head to the members, preserving others.

It doesn't preserve or copy STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE.  This is not
normally a problem as STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE is cleared when a
stripe_head is added to a batch, and is not set on stripe_heads
already in a batch.

However there is no locking to ensure one thread doesn't set the flag
after it has just been cleared in another.  This does occasionally happen.

md/raid5 maintains a count of the number of stripe_heads with
STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE set: conf->preread_active_stripes.  When
break_stripe_batch_list clears STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE inadvertently
this could becomes incorrect and will never again return to zero.

md/raid5 delays the handling of some stripe_heads until
preread_active_stripes becomes zero.  So when the above mention race
happens, those stripe_heads become blocked and never progress,
resulting is write to the array handing.

So: change break_stripe_batch_list to preserve STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE
in the members of a batch.
