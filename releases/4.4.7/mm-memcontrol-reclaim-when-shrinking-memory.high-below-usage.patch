Subject: mm: memcontrol: reclaim when shrinking memory.high below usage

From: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>

commit 588083bb37a3cea8533c392370a554417c8f29cb upstream.

When setting memory.high below usage, nothing happens until the next
charge comes along, and then it will only reclaim its own charge and not
the now potentially huge excess of the new memory.high.  This can cause
groups to stay in excess of their memory.high indefinitely.

To fix that, when shrinking memory.high, kick off a reclaim cycle that
goes after the delta.
