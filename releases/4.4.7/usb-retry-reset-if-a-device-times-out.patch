Subject: usb: retry reset if a device times out

From: Oliver Neukum <oneukum@suse.com>

commit 264904ccc33c604d4b3141bbd33808152dfac45b upstream.

Some devices I got show an inability to operate right after
power on if they are already connected. They are beyond recovery
if the descriptors are requested multiple times. So in case of
a timeout we rather bail early and reset again. But it must be
done only on the first loop lest we get into a reset/time out
spiral that can be overcome with a retry.

This patch is a rework of a patch that fell through the cracks.
