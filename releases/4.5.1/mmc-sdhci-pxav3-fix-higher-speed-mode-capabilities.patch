Subject: mmc: sdhci-pxav3: fix higher speed mode capabilities

From: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>

commit 0ca33b4ad9cfc133bb3d93eec1ad0eea83d6f252 upstream.

Commit 1140011ee9d9 ("mmc: sdhci-pxav3: Modify clock settings for the
SDR50 and DDR50 modes") broke any chance of the SDR50 or DDR50 modes
being used.

The commit claims that SDR50 and DDR50 require clock adjustments in
the SDIO3 Configuration register, which is located via the "conf-sdio3"
resource.  However, when this resource is given, we fail to read the
host capabilities 1 register, resulting in host->caps1 being zero.
Hence, both SDHCI_SUPPORT_SDR50 and SDHCI_SUPPORT_DDR50 bits remain
zero, disabling the SDR50 and DDR50 modes.

The underlying idea in this function appears to be to read the device
capabilities, modify them, and set SDHCI_QUIRK_MISSING_CAPS to cause
our modified capabilities to be used.  Implement exactly that.
