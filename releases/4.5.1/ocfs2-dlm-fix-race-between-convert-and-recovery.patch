Subject: ocfs2/dlm: fix race between convert and recovery

From: Joseph Qi <joseph.qi@huawei.com>

commit ac7cf246dfdbec3d8fed296c7bf30e16f5099dac upstream.

There is a race window between dlmconvert_remote and
dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list, which will cause a lock with
OCFS2_LOCK_BUSY in grant list, thus system hangs.

dlmconvert_remote
{
        spin_lock(&res->spinlock);
        list_move_tail(&lock->list, &res->converting);
        lock->convert_pending = 1;
        spin_unlock(&res->spinlock);

        status = dlm_send_remote_convert_request();
        >>>>>> race window, master has queued ast and return DLM_NORMAL,
               and then down before sending ast.
               this node detects master down and calls
               dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list, which will revert the
               lock to grant list.
               Then OCFS2_LOCK_BUSY won't be cleared as new master won't
               send ast any more because it thinks already be authorized.

        spin_lock(&res->spinlock);
        lock->convert_pending = 0;
        if (status != DLM_NORMAL)
                dlm_revert_pending_convert(res, lock);
        spin_unlock(&res->spinlock);
}

In this case, check if res->state has DLM_LOCK_RES_RECOVERING bit set
(res is still in recovering) or res master changed (new master has
finished recovery), reset the status to DLM_RECOVERING, then it will
retry convert.
