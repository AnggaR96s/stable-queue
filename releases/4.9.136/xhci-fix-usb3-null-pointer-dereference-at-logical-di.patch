Subject: xhci: Fix USB3 NULL pointer dereference at logical disconnect.

[ Upstream commit 2278446e2b7cd33ad894b32e7eb63afc7db6c86e ]

Hub driver will try to disable a USB3 device twice at logical disconnect,
racing with xhci_free_dev() callback from the first port disable.

This can be triggered with "udisksctl power-off --block-device <disk>"
or by writing "1" to the "remove" sysfs file for a USB3 device
in 4.17-rc4.

USB3 devices don't have a similar disabled link state as USB2 devices,
and use a U3 suspended link state instead. In this state the port
is still enabled and connected.

hub_port_connect() first disconnects the device, then later it notices
that device is still enabled (due to U3 states) it will try to disable
the port again (set to U3).

The xhci_free_dev() called during device disable is async, so checking
for existing xhci->devs[i] when setting link state to U3 the second time
was successful, even if device was being freed.

The regression was caused by, and whole thing revealed by,
Commit 44a182b9d177 ("xhci: Fix use-after-free in xhci_free_virt_device")
which sets xhci->devs[i]->udev to NULL before xhci_virt_dev() returned.
and causes a NULL pointer dereference the second time we try to set U3.

Fix this by checking xhci->devs[i]->udev exists before setting link state.

The original patch went to stable so this fix needs to be applied there as
well.
