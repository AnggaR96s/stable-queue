Subject: ASoC: dapm: Recalculate audio map forcely when card instantiated

[ Upstream commit 882eab6c28d23a970ae73b7eb831b169a672d456 ]

Audio map are possible in wrong state before card->instantiated has
been set to true.  Imaging the following examples:

time 1: at the beginning

  in:-1    in:-1    in:-1    in:-1
 out:-1   out:-1   out:-1   out:-1
 SIGGEN        A        B      Spk

time 2: after someone called snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets()
(e.g. create_fill_widget_route_map() in sound/soc/codecs/hdac_hdmi.c)

   in:1     in:0     in:0     in:0
  out:0    out:0    out:0    out:1
 SIGGEN        A        B      Spk

time 3: routes added

   in:1     in:0     in:0     in:0
  out:0    out:0    out:0    out:1
 SIGGEN -----> A -----> B ---> Spk

In the end, the path should be powered on but it did not.  At time 3,
"in" of SIGGEN and "out" of Spk did not propagate to their neighbors
because snd_soc_dapm_add_path() will not invalidate the paths if
the card has not instantiated (i.e. card->instantiated is false).
To correct the state of audio map, recalculate the whole map forcely.
