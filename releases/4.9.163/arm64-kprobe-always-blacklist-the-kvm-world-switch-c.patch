Subject: arm64: kprobe: Always blacklist the KVM world-switch code

[ Upstream commit f2b3d8566d81deaca31f4e3163def0bea7746e11 ]

On systems with VHE the kernel and KVM's world-switch code run at the
same exception level. Code that is only used on a VHE system does not
need to be annotated as __hyp_text as it can reside anywhere in the
 kernel text.

__hyp_text was also used to prevent kprobes from patching breakpoint
instructions into this region, as this code runs at a different
exception level. While this is no longer true with VHE, KVM still
switches VBAR_EL1, meaning a kprobe's breakpoint executed in the
world-switch code will cause a hyp-panic.

Move the __hyp_text check in the kprobes blacklist so it applies on
VHE systems too, to cover the common code and guest enter/exit
assembly.
