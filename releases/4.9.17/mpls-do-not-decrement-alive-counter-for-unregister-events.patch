Subject: mpls: Do not decrement alive counter for unregister events

From: David Ahern <dsa@cumulusnetworks.com>


[ Upstream commit 79099aab38c8f5c746748b066ae74ba984fe2cc8 ]

Multipath routes can be rendered usesless when a device in one of the
paths is deleted. For example:

$ ip -f mpls ro ls
100
	nexthop as to 200 via inet 172.16.2.2  dev virt12
	nexthop as to 300 via inet 172.16.3.2  dev br0
101
	nexthop as to 201 via inet6 2000:2::2  dev virt12
	nexthop as to 301 via inet6 2000:3::2  dev br0

$ ip li del br0

When br0 is deleted the other hop is not considered in
mpls_select_multipath because of the alive check -- rt_nhn_alive
is 0.

rt_nhn_alive is decremented once in mpls_ifdown when the device is taken
down (NETDEV_DOWN) and again when it is deleted (NETDEV_UNREGISTER). For
a 2 hop route, deleting one device drops the alive count to 0. Since
devices are taken down before unregistering, the decrement on
NETDEV_UNREGISTER is redundant.
