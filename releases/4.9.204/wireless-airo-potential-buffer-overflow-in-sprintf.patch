Subject: wireless: airo: potential buffer overflow in sprintf()

From: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit 3d39e1bb1c88f32820c5f9271f2c8c2fb9a52bac ]

It looks like we wanted to print a maximum of BSSList_rid.ssidLen bytes
of the ssid, but we accidentally use "%*s" (width) instead of "%.*s"
(precision) so if the ssid doesn't have a NUL terminator this could lead
to an overflow.

Static analysis.  Not tested.

Fixes: e174961ca1a0 ("net: convert print_mac to %pM")
