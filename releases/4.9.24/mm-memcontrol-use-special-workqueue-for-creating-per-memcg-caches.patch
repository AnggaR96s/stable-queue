Subject: mm: memcontrol: use special workqueue for creating per-memcg caches

From: Vladimir Davydov <vdavydov.dev@gmail.com>

commit 13583c3d3224508582ec03d881d0b68dd3ee8e10 upstream.

Creating a lot of cgroups at the same time might stall all worker
threads with kmem cache creation works, because kmem cache creation is
done with the slab_mutex held.  The problem was amplified by commits
801faf0db894 ("mm/slab: lockless decision to grow cache") in case of
SLAB and 81ae6d03952c ("mm/slub.c: replace kick_all_cpus_sync() with
synchronize_sched() in kmem_cache_shrink()") in case of SLUB, which
increased the maximal time the slab_mutex can be held.

To prevent that from happening, let's use a special ordered single
threaded workqueue for kmem cache creation.  This shouldn't introduce
any functional changes regarding how kmem caches are created, as the
work function holds the global slab_mutex during its whole runtime
anyway, making it impossible to run more than one work at a time.  By
using a single threaded workqueue, we just avoid creating a thread per
each work.  Ordering is required to avoid a situation when a cgroup's
work is put off indefinitely because there are other cgroups to serve,
in other words to guarantee fairness.
