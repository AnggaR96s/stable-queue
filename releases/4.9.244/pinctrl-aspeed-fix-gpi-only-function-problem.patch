Subject: pinctrl: aspeed: Fix GPI only function problem.

From: Billy Tsai <billy_tsai@aspeedtech.com>

[ Upstream commit 9b92f5c51e9a41352d665f6f956bd95085a56a83 ]

Some gpio pin at aspeed soc is input only and the prefix name of these
pin is "GPI" only.
This patch fine-tune the condition of GPIO check from "GPIO" to "GPI"
and it will fix the usage error of banks D and E in the AST2400/AST2500
and banks T and U in the AST2600.

Fixes: 4d3d0e4272d8 ("pinctrl: Add core support for Aspeed SoCs")
