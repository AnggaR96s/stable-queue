Subject: ARM: dts: at91: at91sam9rl: fix ADC triggers

From: Alexandre Belloni <alexandre.belloni@bootlin.com>

[ Upstream commit 851a95da583c26e2ddeb7281e9b61f0d76ea5aba ]

The triggers for the ADC were taken from at91sam9260 dtsi but are not
correct.

Fixes: a4c1d6c75822 ("ARM: at91/dt: sam9rl: add lcd, adc, usb gadget and pwm support")
