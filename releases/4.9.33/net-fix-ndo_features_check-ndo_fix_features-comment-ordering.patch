Subject: net: fix ndo_features_check/ndo_fix_features comment ordering

From: Dimitris Michailidis <dmichail@google.com>


[ Upstream commit 1a2a14444d32b89b28116daea86f63ced1716668 ]

Commit cdba756f5803a2 ("net: move ndo_features_check() close to
ndo_start_xmit()") inadvertently moved the doc comment for
.ndo_fix_features instead of .ndo_features_check. Fix the comment
ordering.
