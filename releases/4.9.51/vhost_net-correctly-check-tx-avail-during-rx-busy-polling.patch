Subject: vhost_net: correctly check tx avail during rx busy polling

From: Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>


[ Upstream commit 8b949bef9172ca69d918e93509a4ecb03d0355e0 ]

We check tx avail through vhost_enable_notify() in the past which is
wrong since it only checks whether or not guest has filled more
available buffer since last avail idx synchronization which was just
done by vhost_vq_avail_empty() before. What we really want is checking
pending buffers in the avail ring. Fix this by calling
vhost_vq_avail_empty() instead.

This issue could be noticed by doing netperf TCP_RR benchmark as
client from guest (but not host). With this fix, TCP_RR from guest to
localhost restores from 1375.91 trans per sec to 55235.28 trans per
sec on my laptop (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5600U CPU @ 2.60GHz).
