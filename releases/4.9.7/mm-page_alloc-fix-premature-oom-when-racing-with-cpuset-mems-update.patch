Subject: mm, page_alloc: fix premature OOM when racing with cpuset mems update

From: Vlastimil Babka <vbabka@suse.cz>

commit e47483bca2cc59a4593b37a270b16ee42b1d9f08 upstream.

Ganapatrao Kulkarni reported that the LTP test cpuset01 in stress mode
triggers OOM killer in few seconds, despite lots of free memory.  The
test attempts to repeatedly fault in memory in one process in a cpuset,
while changing allowed nodes of the cpuset between 0 and 1 in another
process.

The problem comes from insufficient protection against cpuset changes,
which can cause get_page_from_freelist() to consider all zones as
non-eligible due to nodemask and/or current->mems_allowed.  This was
masked in the past by sufficient retries, but since commit 682a3385e773
("mm, page_alloc: inline the fast path of the zonelist iterator") we fix
the preferred_zoneref once, and don't iterate over the whole zonelist in
further attempts, thus the only eligible zones might be placed in the
zonelist before our starting point and we always miss them.

A previous patch fixed this problem for current->mems_allowed.  However,
cpuset changes also update the task's mempolicy nodemask.  The fix has
two parts.  We have to repeat the preferred_zoneref search when we
detect cpuset update by way of seqcount, and we have to check the
seqcount before considering OOM.
