Subject: mm: hwpoison: call shake_page() after try_to_unmap() for mlocked page

From: Naoya Horiguchi <n-horiguchi@ah.jp.nec.com>


[ Upstream commit 286c469a988fbaf68e3a97ddf1e6c245c1446968 ]

Memory error handler calls try_to_unmap() for error pages in various
states.  If the error page is a mlocked page, error handling could fail
with "still referenced by 1 users" message.  This is because the page is
linked to and stays in lru cache after the following call chain.

  try_to_unmap_one
    page_remove_rmap
      clear_page_mlock
        putback_lru_page
          lru_cache_add

memory_failure() calls shake_page() to hanlde the similar issue, but
current code doesn't cover because shake_page() is called only before
try_to_unmap().  So this patches adds shake_page().

Fixes: 23a003bfd23ea9ea0b7756b920e51f64b284b468 ("mm/madvise: pass return code of memory_failure() to userspace")
