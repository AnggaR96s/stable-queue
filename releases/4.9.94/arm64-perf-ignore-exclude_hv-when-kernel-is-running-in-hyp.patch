Subject: arm64: perf: Ignore exclude_hv when kernel is running in HYP

From: Ganapatrao Kulkarni <ganapatrao.kulkarni@cavium.com>


[ Upstream commit 78a19cfdf37d19002c83c8790853c1cc10feccdc ]

commit d98ecdaca296 ("arm64: perf: Count EL2 events if the kernel is
running in HYP") returns -EINVAL when perf system call perf_event_open is
called with exclude_hv != exclude_kernel. This change breaks applications
on VHE enabled ARMv8.1 platforms. The issue was observed with HHVM
application, which calls perf_event_open with exclude_hv = 1 and
exclude_kernel = 0.

There is no separate hypervisor privilege level when VHE is enabled, the
host kernel runs at EL2. So when VHE is enabled, we should ignore
exclude_hv from the application. This behaviour is consistent with PowerPC
where the exclude_hv is ignored when the hypervisor is not present and with
x86 where this flag is ignored.
