Subject: mwifiex: Make resume actually do something useful again on SDIO cards

From: Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>

commit b82d6c1f8f8288f744a9dcc16cd3085d535decca upstream.

The commit fc3a2fcaa1ba ("mwifiex: use atomic bitops to represent
adapter status variables") had a fairly straightforward bug in it.  It
contained this bit of diff:

 - if (!adapter->is_suspended) {
 + if (test_bit(MWIFIEX_IS_SUSPENDED, &adapter->work_flags)) {

As you can see the patch missed the "!" when converting to the atomic
bitops.  This meant that the resume hasn't done anything at all since
that commit landed and suspend/resume for mwifiex SDIO cards has been
totally broken.

After fixing this mwifiex suspend/resume appears to work again, at
least with the simple testing I've done.
