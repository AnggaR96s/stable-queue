Subject: svcrdma: Ignore source port when computing DRC hash

From: Chuck Lever <chuck.lever@oracle.com>

commit 1e091c3bbf51d34d5d96337a59ce5ab2ac3ba2cc upstream.

The DRC appears to be effectively empty after an RPC/RDMA transport
reconnect. The problem is that each connection uses a different
source port, which defeats the DRC hash.

Clients always have to disconnect before they send retransmissions
to reset the connection's credit accounting, thus every retransmit
on NFS/RDMA will miss the DRC.

An NFS/RDMA client's IP source port is meaningless for RDMA
transports. The transport layer typically sets the source port value
on the connection to a random ephemeral port. The server already
ignores it for the "secure port" check. See commit 16e4d93f6de7
("NFSD: Ignore client's source port on RDMA transports").

The Linux NFS server's DRC resolves XID collisions from the same
source IP address by using the checksum of the first 200 bytes of
the RPC call header.
