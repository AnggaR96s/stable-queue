Subject: perf: arm-spe: Fix perf report --mem-mode

From: James Clark <james.clark@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit ffab487052054162b3b6c9c6005777ec6cfcea05 ]

Since commit bb30acae4c4dacfa ("perf report: Bail out --mem-mode if mem
info is not available") "perf mem report" and "perf report --mem-mode"
don't allow opening the file unless one of the events has
PERF_SAMPLE_DATA_SRC set.

SPE doesn't have this set even though synthetic memory data is generated
after it is decoded. Fix this issue by setting DATA_SRC on SPE events.
This has no effect on the data collected because the SPE driver doesn't
do anything with that flag and doesn't generate samples.

Fixes: bb30acae4c4dacfa ("perf report: Bail out --mem-mode if mem info is not available")
