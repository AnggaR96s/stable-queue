Subject: ALSA: usb-audio: Restore Rane SL-1 quirk

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 5c62383c06837b5719cd5447a5758b791279e653 upstream.

At cleaning up and moving the device rename from the quirk table to
its own table, we removed the entry for Rane SL-1 as we thought it's
only for renaming.  It turned out, however, that the quirk is required
for matching with the device that declares itself as no standard
audio but only as vendor-specific.

Restore the quirk entry for Rane SL-1 to fix the regression.
