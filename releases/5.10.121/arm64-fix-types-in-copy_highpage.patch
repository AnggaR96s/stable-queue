Subject: arm64: fix types in copy_highpage()

From: Tong Tiangen <tongtiangen@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 921d161f15d6b090599f6a8c23f131969edbd1fa ]

In copy_highpage() the `kto` and `kfrom` local variables are pointers to
struct page, but these are used to hold arbitrary pointers to kernel memory
. Each call to page_address() returns a void pointer to memory associated
with the relevant page, and copy_page() expects void pointers to this
memory.

This inconsistency was introduced in commit 2563776b41c3 ("arm64: mte:
Tags-aware copy_{user_,}highpage() implementations") and while this
doesn't appear to be harmful in practice it is clearly wrong.

Correct this by making `kto` and `kfrom` void pointers.
