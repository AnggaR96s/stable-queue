Subject: selftests/xsk: Destroy BPF resources only when ctx refcount drops to
 0

From: Maciej Fijalkowski <maciej.fijalkowski@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 39e940d4abfabb08b6937a315546b24d10be67e3 ]

Currently, xsk_socket__delete frees BPF resources regardless of ctx
refcount. Xdpxceiver has a test to verify whether underlying BPF
resources would not be wiped out after closing XSK socket that was
bound to interface with other active sockets. From library's xsk part
perspective it also means that the internal xsk context is shared and
its refcount is bumped accordingly.

After a switch to loading XDP prog based on previously opened XSK
socket, mentioned xdpxceiver test fails with:

  not ok 16 [xdpxceiver.c:swap_xsk_resources:1334]: ERROR: 9/"Bad file descriptor

which means that in swap_xsk_resources(), xsk_socket__delete() released
xskmap which in turn caused a failure of xsk_socket__update_xskmap().

To fix this, when deleting socket, decrement ctx refcount before
releasing BPF resources and do so only when refcount dropped to 0 which
means there are no more active sockets for this ctx so BPF resources can
be freed safely.
