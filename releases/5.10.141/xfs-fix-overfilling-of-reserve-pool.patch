From: "Darrick J. Wong" <djwong@kernel.org>

commit 82be38bcf8a2e056b4c99ce79a3827fa743df6ec upstream.

Due to cycling of m_sb_lock, it's possible for multiple callers of
xfs_reserve_blocks to race at changing the pool size, subtracting blocks
from fdblocks, and actually putting it in the pool.  The result of all
this is that we can overfill the reserve pool to hilarious levels.

xfs_mod_fdblocks, when called with a positive value, already knows how
to take freed blocks and either fill the reserve until it's full, or put
them in fdblocks.  Use that instead of setting m_resblks_avail directly.
