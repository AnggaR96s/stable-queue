Subject: drm/i915/gt: Reset twice

From: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>

[ Upstream commit d3de5616d36462a646f5b360ba82d3b09ff668eb ]

After applying an engine reset, on some platforms like Jasperlake, we
occasionally detect that the engine state is not cleared until shortly
after the resume. As we try to resume the engine with volatile internal
state, the first request fails with a spurious CS event (it looks like
it reports a lite-restore to the hung context, instead of the expected
idle->active context switch).
