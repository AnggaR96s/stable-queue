Subject: nvme-pci: fix timeout request state check

From: Keith Busch <kbusch@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 1c5842085851f786eba24a39ecd02650ad892064 ]

Polling the completion can progress the request state to IDLE, either
inline with the completion, or through softirq. Either way, the state
may not be COMPLETED, so don't check for that. We only care if the state
isn't IN_FLIGHT.

This is fixing an issue where the driver aborts an IO that we just
completed. Seeing the "aborting" message instead of "polled" is very
misleading as to where the timeout problem resides.

Fixes: bf392a5dc02a9b ("nvme-pci: Remove tag from process cq")
