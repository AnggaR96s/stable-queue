Subject: tmpfs: disallow CONFIG_TMPFS_INODE64 on s390

From: Seth Forshee <seth.forshee@canonical.com>

commit b85a7a8bb5736998b8a681937a9749b350c17988 upstream.

Currently there is an assumption in tmpfs that 64-bit architectures also
have a 64-bit ino_t.  This is not true on s390 which has a 32-bit ino_t.
With CONFIG_TMPFS_INODE64=y tmpfs mounts will get 64-bit inode numbers
and display "inode64" in the mount options, but passing the "inode64"
mount option will fail.  This leads to the following behavior:

  # mkdir mnt
  # mount -t tmpfs nodev mnt
  # mount -o remount,rw mnt
  mount: /home/ubuntu/mnt: mount point not mounted or bad option.

As mount sees "inode64" in the mount options and thus passes it in the
options for the remount.

So prevent CONFIG_TMPFS_INODE64 from being selected on s390.
