Subject: fbdev: tgafb: Fix potential divide by zero

From: Wei Chen <harperchen1110@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit f90bd245de82c095187d8c2cabb8b488a39eaecc ]

fb_set_var would by called when user invokes ioctl with cmd
FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO. User-provided data would finally reach
tgafb_check_var. In case var->pixclock is assigned to zero,
divide by zero would occur when checking whether reciprocal
of var->pixclock is too high.

Similar crashes have happened in other fbdev drivers. There
is no check and modification on var->pixclock along the call
chain to tgafb_check_var. We believe it could also be triggered
in driver tgafb from user site.
