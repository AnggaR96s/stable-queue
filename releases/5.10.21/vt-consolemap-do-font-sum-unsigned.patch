Subject: vt/consolemap: do font sum unsigned

From: Jiri Slaby <jslaby@suse.cz>

[ Upstream commit 9777f8e60e718f7b022a94f2524f967d8def1931 ]

The constant 20 makes the font sum computation signed which can lead to
sign extensions and signed wraps. It's not much of a problem as we build
with -fno-strict-overflow. But if we ever decide not to, be ready, so
switch the constant to unsigned.
