Subject: i3c: fix incorrect address slot lookup on 64-bit

From: Jamie Iles <quic_jiles@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit f18f98110f2b179792cb70d85cba697320a3790f ]

The address slot bitmap is an array of unsigned long's which are the
same size as an int on 32-bit platforms but not 64-bit.  Loading the
bitmap into an int could result in the incorrect status being returned
for a slot and slots being reported as the wrong status.
