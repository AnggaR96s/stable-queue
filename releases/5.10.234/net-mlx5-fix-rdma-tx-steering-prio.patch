Subject: net/mlx5: Fix RDMA TX steering prio

From: Patrisious Haddad <phaddad@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit c08d3e62b2e73e14da318a1d20b52d0486a28ee0 ]

User added steering rules at RDMA_TX were being added to the first prio,
which is the counters prio.
Fix that so that they are correctly added to the BYPASS_PRIO instead.

Fixes: 24670b1a3166 ("net/mlx5: Add support for RDMA TX steering")
