Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: msm8994: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit a4148d869d47d8c86da0291dd95d411a5ebe90c8 ]

The MSM8994 platform uses PM8994/6 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
