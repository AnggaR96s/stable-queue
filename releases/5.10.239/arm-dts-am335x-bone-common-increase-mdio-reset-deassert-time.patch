Subject: ARM: dts: am335x-bone-common: Increase MDIO reset deassert time

From: Colin Foster <colin.foster@in-advantage.com>

commit b9bf5612610aa7e38d58fee16f489814db251c01 upstream.

Prior to commit df16c1c51d81 ("net: phy: mdio_device: Reset device only
when necessary") MDIO reset deasserts were performed twice during boot.
Now that the second deassert is no longer performed, device probe
failures happen due to the change in timing with the following error
message:

SMSC LAN8710/LAN8720: probe of 4a101000.mdio:00 failed with error -5

Restore the original effective timing, which resolves the probe
failures.
