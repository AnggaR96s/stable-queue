Subject: block: Try to handle busy underlying device on discard

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

commit 56887cffe946bb0a90c74429fa94d6110a73119d upstream.

Commit 384d87ef2c95 ("block: Do not discard buffers under a mounted
filesystem") made paths issuing discard or zeroout requests to the
underlying device try to grab block device in exclusive mode. If that
failed we returned EBUSY to userspace. This however caused unexpected
fallout in userspace where e.g. FUSE filesystems issue discard requests
from userspace daemons although the device is open exclusively by the
kernel. Also shrinking of logical volume by LVM issues discard requests
to a device which may be claimed exclusively because there's another LV
on the same PV. So to avoid these userspace regressions, fall back to
invalidate_inode_pages2_range() instead of returning EBUSY to userspace
and return EBUSY only of that call fails as well (meaning that there's
indeed someone using the particular device range we are trying to
discard).
