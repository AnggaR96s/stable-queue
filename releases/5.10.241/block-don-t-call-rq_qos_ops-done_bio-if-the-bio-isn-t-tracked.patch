Subject: block: don't call rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't tracked

From: Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com>

commit a647a524a46736786c95cdb553a070322ca096e3 upstream.

rq_qos framework is only applied on request based driver, so:

1) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio based driver

2) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio which isn't tracked,
such as bios ended from error handling code.

Especially in bio_endio():

1) request queue is referred via bio->bi_bdev->bd_disk->queue, which
may be gone since request queue refcount may not be held in above two
cases

2) q->rq_qos may be freed in blk_cleanup_queue() when calling into
__rq_qos_done_bio()

Fix the potential kernel panic by not calling rq_qos_ops->done_bio if
the bio isn't tracked. This way is safe because both ioc_rqos_done_bio()
and blkcg_iolatency_done_bio() are nop if the bio isn't tracked.
