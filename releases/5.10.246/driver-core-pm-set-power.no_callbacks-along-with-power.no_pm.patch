Subject: driver core/PM: Set power.no_callbacks along with power.no_pm

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

commit c2ce2453413d429e302659abc5ace634e873f6f5 upstream.

Devices with power.no_pm set are not expected to need any power
management at all, so modify device_set_pm_not_required() to set
power.no_callbacks for them too in case runtime PM will be enabled
for any of them (which in principle may be done for convenience if
such a device participates in a dependency chain).

Since device_set_pm_not_required() must be called before device_add()
or it would not have any effect, it can update power.no_callbacks
without locking, unlike pm_runtime_no_callbacks() that can be called
after registering the target device.
