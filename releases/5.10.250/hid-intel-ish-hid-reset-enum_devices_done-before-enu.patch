Subject: HID: intel-ish-hid: Reset enum_devices_done before enumeration

From: Zhang Lixu <lixu.zhang@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 56e230723e3a818373bd62331bccb1c6d2b3881b ]

Some systems have enabled ISH without any sensors. In this case sending
HOSTIF_DM_ENUM_DEVICES results in 0 sensors. This triggers ISH hardware
reset on subsequent enumeration after S3/S4 resume.

The enum_devices_done flag was not reset before sending the
HOSTIF_DM_ENUM_DEVICES command. On subsequent enumeration calls (such as
after S3/S4 resume), this flag retains its previous true value, causing the
wait loop to be skipped and returning prematurely to hid_ishtp_cl_init().
If 0 HID devices are found, hid_ishtp_cl_init() skips getting HID device
descriptors and sets init_done to true. When the delayed enumeration
response arrives with init_done already true, the driver treats it as a bad
packet and triggers an ISH hardware reset.

Set enum_devices_done to false before sending the enumeration command,
consistent with similar functions like ishtp_get_hid_descriptor() and
ishtp_get_report_descriptor() which reset their respective flags.
