Subject: nvme-fc: set NVME_REQ_CANCELLED in nvme_fc_terminate_exchange()

From: Hannes Reinecke <hare@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 3c7aafbc8d3d4d90430dfa126847a796c3e4ecfc ]

nvme_fc_terminate_exchange() is being called when exchanges are
being deleted, and as such we should be setting the NVME_REQ_CANCELLED
flag to have identical behaviour on all transports.
