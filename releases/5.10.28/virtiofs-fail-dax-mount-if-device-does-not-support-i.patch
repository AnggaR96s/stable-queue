Subject: virtiofs: Fail dax mount if device does not support it

From: Vivek Goyal <vgoyal@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 3f9b9efd82a84f27e95d0414f852caf1fa839e83 ]

Right now "mount -t virtiofs -o dax myfs /mnt/virtiofs" succeeds even
if filesystem deivce does not have a cache window and hence DAX can't
be supported.

This gives a false sense to user that they are using DAX with virtiofs
but fact of the matter is that they are not.

Fix this by returning error if dax can't be supported and user has asked
for it.
