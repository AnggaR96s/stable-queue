Subject: lib/lz4: explicitly support in-place decompression

From: Gao Xiang <hsiangkao@redhat.com>

commit 89b158635ad79574bde8e94d45dad33f8cf09549 upstream.

LZ4 final literal copy could be overlapped when doing
in-place decompression, so it's unsafe to just use memcpy()
on an optimized memcpy approach but memmove() instead.

Upstream LZ4 has updated this years ago [1] (and the impact
is non-sensible [2] plus only a few bytes remain), this commit
just synchronizes LZ4 upstream code to the kernel side as well.

It can be observed as EROFS in-place decompression failure
on specific files when X86_FEATURE_ERMS is unsupported,
memcpy() optimization of commit 59daa706fbec ("x86, mem:
Optimize memcpy by avoiding memory false dependece") will
be enabled then.

Currently most modern x86-CPUs support ERMS, these CPUs just
use "rep movsb" approach so no problem at all. However, it can
still be verified with forcely disabling ERMS feature...

arch/x86/lib/memcpy_64.S:
        ALTERNATIVE_2 "jmp memcpy_orig", "", X86_FEATURE_REP_GOOD, \
-                     "jmp memcpy_erms", X86_FEATURE_ERMS
+                     "jmp memcpy_orig", X86_FEATURE_ERMS

We didn't observe any strange on arm64/arm/x86 platform before
since most memcpy() would behave in an increasing address order
("copy upwards" [3]) and it's the correct order of in-place
decompression but it really needs an update to memmove() for sure
considering it's an undefined behavior according to the standard
and some unique optimization already exists in the kernel.
