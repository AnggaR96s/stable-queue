Subject: s390/ipl_parm: fix program check new psw handling

From: Heiko Carstens <hca@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit 88c2510cecb7e2b518e3c4fdf3cf0e13ebe9377c ]

The __diag308() inline asm temporarily changes the program check new
psw to redirect a potential program check on the diag instruction.
Restoring of the program check new psw is done in C code behind the
inline asm.

This can be problematic, especially if the function is inlined, since
the compiler can reorder instructions in such a way that a different
instruction, which may result in a program check, might be executed
before the program check new psw has been restored.

To avoid such a scenario move restoring into the inline asm. For
consistency reasons move also saving of the original program check new
psw into the inline asm.
