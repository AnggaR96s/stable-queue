Subject: ARM: dts: stm32: fix the Odyssey SoM eMMC VQMMC supply

[ Upstream commit f493162319788802b6a49634f7268e691b4c10ec ]

The Seeed SoM-STM32MP157C device tree had the eMMC’s (SDMMC2) VQMMC
supply set to v3v3 (buck4), the same as the VMMC supply. That was
incorrect, as on the SoM, the VQMMC supply is provided from vdd (buck3)
instead.
