Subject: arm64: dts: renesas: rzg2: Convert EtherAVB to explicit delay
 handling

From: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>

[ Upstream commit a5200e63af57d05ed8bf0ffd9a6ffefc40e01e89 ]

Some EtherAVB variants support internal clock delay configuration, which
can add larger delays than the delays that are typically supported by
the PHY (using an "rgmii-*id" PHY mode, and/or "[rt]xc-skew-ps"
properties).

Historically, the EtherAVB driver configured these delays based on the
"rgmii-*id" PHY mode.  This was wrong, as these are meant solely for the
PHY, not for the MAC.  Hence properties were introduced for explicit
configuration of these delays.

Convert the RZ/G2 DTS files from the old to the new scheme:
  - Add default "rx-internal-delay-ps" and "tx-internal-delay-ps"
    properties to the SoC .dtsi files, to be overridden by board files
    where needed,
  - Convert board files from "rgmii-*id" PHY modes to "rgmii", adding
    the appropriate "rx-internal-delay-ps" and/or "tx-internal-delay-ps"
    overrides.

Notes:
  - RZ/G2E does not support TX internal delay handling.
