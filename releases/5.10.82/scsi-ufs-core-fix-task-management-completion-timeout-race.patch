Subject: scsi: ufs: core: Fix task management completion timeout race

From: Adrian Hunter <adrian.hunter@intel.com>

commit 886fe2915cce6658b0fc19e64b82879325de61ea upstream.

__ufshcd_issue_tm_cmd() clears req->end_io_data after timing out, which
races with the completion function ufshcd_tmc_handler() which expects
req->end_io_data to have a value.

Note __ufshcd_issue_tm_cmd() and ufshcd_tmc_handler() are already
synchronized using hba->tmf_rqs and hba->outstanding_tasks under the
host_lock spinlock.

It is also not necessary (nor typical) to clear req->end_io_data because
the block layer does it before allocating out requests e.g. via
blk_get_request().

So fix by not clearing it.
