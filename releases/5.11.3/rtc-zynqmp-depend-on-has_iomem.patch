Subject: rtc: zynqmp: depend on HAS_IOMEM

From: David Gow <davidgow@google.com>

[ Upstream commit ddd0521549a975e6148732d6ca6b89ffa862c0e5 ]

The Xilinx zynqmp RTC driver makes use of IOMEM functions like
devm_platform_ioremap_resource(), which are only available if
CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM is defined.

This causes the driver not to be enable under make ARCH=um allyesconfig,
even though it won't build.

By adding a dependency on HAS_IOMEM, the driver will not be enabled on
architectures which don't support it.

Fixes: 09ef18bcd5ac ("rtc: use devm_platform_ioremap_resource() to simplify code")
