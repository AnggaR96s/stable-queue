Subject: PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Make expansion ROM Base Address register read-only
MIME-Version: 1.0

commit 1c1a3b4d3e86b997a313ffb297c1129540882859 upstream.

If expansion ROM is unsupported (which is the case of pci-bridge-emul.c
driver) then ROM Base Address register must be implemented as read-only
register that return 0 when read, same as for unused Base Address
registers.
