Subject: ceph: give up on paths longer than PATH_MAX

commit 550f7ca98ee028a606aa75705a7e77b1bd11720f upstream.

If the full path to be built by ceph_mdsc_build_path() happens to be
longer than PATH_MAX, then this function will enter an endless (retry)
loop, effectively blocking the whole task.  Most of the machine
becomes unusable, making this a very simple and effective DoS
vulnerability.

I cannot imagine why this retry was ever implemented, but it seems
rather useless and harmful to me.  Let's remove it and fail with
ENAMETOOLONG instead.
