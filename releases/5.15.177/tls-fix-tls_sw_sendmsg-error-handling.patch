Subject: tls: Fix tls_sw_sendmsg error handling

From: Benjamin Coddington <bcodding@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit b341ca51d2679829d26a3f6a4aa9aee9abd94f92 ]

We've noticed that NFS can hang when using RPC over TLS on an unstable
connection, and investigation shows that the RPC layer is stuck in a tight
loop attempting to transmit, but forever getting -EBADMSG back from the
underlying network.  The loop begins when tcp_sendmsg_locked() returns
-EPIPE to tls_tx_records(), but that error is converted to -EBADMSG when
calling the socket's error reporting handler.

Instead of converting errors from tcp_sendmsg_locked(), let's pass them
along in this path.  The RPC layer handles -EPIPE by reconnecting the
transport, which prevents the endless attempts to transmit on a broken
connection.
