Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit f6ccdca14eac545320ab03d6ca91ca343e7372e5 ]

The SC7280 platform uses PMK8350 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
