Subject: kfence: allow use of a deferrable timer

From: Marco Elver <elver@google.com>

[ Upstream commit 737b6a10ac19e41877aa1911bf6b361a72a88ad9 ]

Allow the use of a deferrable timer, which does not force CPU wake-ups
when the system is idle.  A consequence is that the sample interval
becomes very unpredictable, to the point that it is not guaranteed that
the KFENCE KUnit test still passes.

Nevertheless, on power-constrained systems this may be preferable, so
let's give the user the option should they accept the above trade-off.

+The sample interval controls a timer that sets up KFENCE allocations. By
+default, to keep the real sample interval predictable, the normal timer also
+causes CPU wake-ups when the system is completely idle. This may be undesirable
+on power-constrained systems. The boot parameter ``kfence.deferrable=1``

+.. warning::
+   The KUnit test suite is very likely to fail when using a deferrable timer
+   since it currently causes very unpredictable sample intervals.

 The KFENCE memory pool is of fixed size, and if the pool is exhausted, no
 further KFENCE allocations occur. With ``CONFIG_KFENCE_NUM_OBJECTS`` (default
 255), the number of available guarded objects can be controlled. Each object
