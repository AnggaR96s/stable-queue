Subject: dma-buf: fix timeout handling in dma_resv_wait_timeout v2
MIME-Version: 1.0

[ Upstream commit 2b95a7db6e0f75587bffddbb490399cbb87e4985 ]

Even the kerneldoc says that with a zero timeout the function should not
wait for anything, but still return 1 to indicate that the fences are
signaled now.

Unfortunately that isn't what was implemented, instead of only returning
1 we also waited for at least one jiffies.

Fix that by adjusting the handling to what the function is actually
documented to do.

v2: improve code readability
