Subject: thermal/drivers/qcom: Make LMH select QCOM_SCM

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@oss.qualcomm.com>

[ Upstream commit 57eda47bd14b0c2876f2db42e757c57b7a671965 ]

The QCOM_SCM symbol is not user-visible, so it makes little sense to
depend on it. Make LMH driver select QCOM_SCM as all other drivers do
and, as the dependecy is now correctly handled, enable || COMPILE_TEST
in order to include the driver into broader set of build tests.

Fixes: 9e5a4fb84230 ("thermal/drivers/qcom/lmh: make QCOM_LMH depends on QCOM_SCM")
