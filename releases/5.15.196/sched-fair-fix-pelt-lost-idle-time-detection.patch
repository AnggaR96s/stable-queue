Subject: sched/fair: Fix pelt lost idle time detection

From: Vincent Guittot <vincent.guittot@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 17e3e88ed0b6318fde0d1c14df1a804711cab1b5 ]

The check for some lost idle pelt time should be always done when
pick_next_task_fair() fails to pick a task and not only when we call it
from the fair fast-path.

The case happens when the last running task on rq is a RT or DL task. When
the latter goes to sleep and the /Sum of util_sum of the rq is at the max
value, we don't account the lost of idle time whereas we should.

Fixes: 67692435c411 ("sched: Rework pick_next_task() slow-path")
