Subject: USB: core: Fix RST error in hub.c

From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

commit 766a96dc558385be735a370db867e302c8f22153 upstream.

A recent commit added an invalid RST expression to a kerneldoc comment
in hub.c.  The fix is trivial.

Fixes: 9c6d778800b9 ("USB: core: Prevent nested device-reset calls")
