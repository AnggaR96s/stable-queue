Subject: bpf: Fix slot type check in check_stack_write_var_off

From: Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi <memxor@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit f5e477a861e4a20d8a1c5f7a245f3a3c3c376b03 ]

For the case where allow_ptr_leaks is false, code is checking whether
slot type is STACK_INVALID and STACK_SPILL and rejecting other cases.
This is a consequence of incorrectly checking for register type instead
of the slot type (NOT_INIT and SCALAR_VALUE respectively). Fix the
check.
