Subject: io_uring: don't gate task_work run on TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>

commit 46a525e199e4037516f7e498c18f065b09df32ac upstream.

This isn't a reliable mechanism to tell if we have task_work pending, we
really should be looking at whether we have any items queued. This is
problematic if forward progress is gated on running said task_work. One
such example is reading from a pipe, where the write side has been closed
right before the read is started. The fput() of the file queues TWA_RESUME
task_work, and we need that task_work to be run before ->release() is
called for the pipe. If ->release() isn't called, then the read will sit
forever waiting on data that will never arise.

Fix this by io_run_task_work() so it checks if we have task_work pending
rather than rely on TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL for that. The latter obviously
doesn't work for task_work that is queued without TWA_SIGNAL.
