Subject: Revert "bcache: set CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE in bch_cached_dev_error()"

From: Coly Li <colyli@suse.de>

commit 695277f16b3a102fcc22c97fdf2de77c7b19f0b3 upstream.

This reverts commit 6147305c73e4511ca1a975b766b97a779d442567.

Although this patch helps the failed bcache device to stop faster when
too many I/O errors detected on corresponding cached device, setting
CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE bit to cache set c->flags was not a good idea. This
operation will disable all I/Os on cache set, which means other attached
bcache devices won't work neither.

Without this patch, the failed bcache device can also be stopped
eventually if internal I/O accomplished (e.g. writeback). Therefore here
I revert it.
