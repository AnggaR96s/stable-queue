Subject: cpufreq: intel_pstate: Get per-CPU max freq via MSR_HWP_CAPABILITIES if available

From: Chen Yu <yu.c.chen@intel.com>

commit 6f67e060083a84a4cc364eab6ae40c717165fb0c upstream.

Currently, when turbo is disabled (either by BIOS or by the user),
the intel_pstate driver reads the max non-turbo frequency from the
package-wide MSR_PLATFORM_INFO(0xce) register.

However, on asymmetric platforms it is possible in theory that small
and big core with HWP enabled might have different max non-turbo CPU
frequency, because MSR_HWP_CAPABILITIES is per-CPU scope according
to Intel Software Developer Manual.

The turbo max freq is already per-CPU in current code, so make
similar change to the max non-turbo frequency as well.
