Subject: usb: dwc2: Prevent core suspend when port connection flag is 0

From: Artur Petrosyan <Arthur.Petrosyan@synopsys.com>

commit 93f672804bf2d7a49ef3fd96827ea6290ca1841e upstream.

In host mode port connection status flag is "0" when loading
the driver. After loading the driver system asserts suspend
which is handled by "_dwc2_hcd_suspend()" function. Before
the system suspend the port connection status is "0". As
result need to check the "port_connect_status" if it is "0",
then skipping entering to suspend.
