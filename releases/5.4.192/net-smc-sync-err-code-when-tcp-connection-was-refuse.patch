Subject: net/smc: sync err code when tcp connection was refused

From: liuyacan <liuyacan@corp.netease.com>

[ Upstream commit 4e2e65e2e56c6ceb4ea1719360080c0af083229e ]

In the current implementation, when TCP initiates a connection
to an unavailable [ip,port], ECONNREFUSED will be stored in the
TCP socket, but SMC will not. However, some apps (like curl) use
getsockopt(,,SO_ERROR,,) to get the error information, which makes
them miss the error message and behave strangely.
