Subject: tty: n_gsm: fix race condition in gsmld_write()

From: Daniel Starke <daniel.starke@siemens.com>

[ Upstream commit 32dd59f96924f45e33bc79854f7a00679c0fa28e ]

The function may be used by the user directly and also by the n_gsm
internal functions. They can lead into a race condition which results in
interleaved frames if both are writing at the same time. The receiving side
is not able to decode those interleaved frames correctly.

Add a lock around the low side tty write to avoid race conditions and frame
interleaving between user originated writes and n_gsm writes.

Fixes: e1eaea46bb40 ("tty: n_gsm line discipline")
