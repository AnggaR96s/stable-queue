Subject: tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_tc_tunnel.sh: Fix wait for server
 bind

From: Marco Leogrande <leogrande@google.com>

[ Upstream commit e2f0791124a1b6ca8d570110cbd487969d9d41ef ]

Commit f803bcf9208a ("selftests/bpf: Prevent client connect before
server bind in test_tc_tunnel.sh") added code that waits for the
netcat server to start before the netcat client attempts to connect to
it. However, not all calls to 'server_listen' were guarded.

This patch adds the existing 'wait_for_port' guard after the remaining
call to 'server_listen'.
