Subject: sched/deadline: Use online cpus for validating runtime

From: Shrikanth Hegde <sshegde@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit 14672f059d83f591afb2ee1fff56858efe055e5a ]

The ftrace selftest reported a failure because writing -1 to
sched_rt_runtime_us returns -EBUSY. This happens when the possible
CPUs are different from active CPUs.

Active CPUs are part of one root domain, while remaining CPUs are part
of def_root_domain. Since active cpumask is being used, this results in
cpus=0 when a non active CPUs is used in the loop.

Fix it by looping over the online CPUs instead for validating the
bandwidth calculations.
