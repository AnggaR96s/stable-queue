Subject: x86/mce: Make sure CMCI banks are cleared during shutdown on Intel

From: JP Kobryn <inwardvessel@gmail.com>

commit 30ad231a5029bfa16e46ce868497b1a5cdd3c24d upstream.

CMCI banks are not cleared during shutdown on Intel CPUs. As a side effect,
when a kexec is performed, CPUs coming back online are unable to
rediscover/claim these occupied banks which breaks MCE reporting.

Clear the CPU ownership during shutdown via cmci_clear() so the banks can
be reclaimed and MCE reporting will become functional once more.
