Subject: sched/fair: Trivial correction of the newidle_balance() comment

From: Barry Song <song.bao.hua@hisilicon.com>

[ Upstream commit 5b78f2dc315354c05300795064f587366a02c6ff ]

idle_balance() has been renamed to newidle_balance(). To differentiate
with nohz_idle_balance, it seems refining the comment will be helpful
for the readers of the code.
