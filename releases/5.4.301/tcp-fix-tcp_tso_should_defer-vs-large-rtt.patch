Subject: tcp: fix tcp_tso_should_defer() vs large RTT

From: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>

[ Upstream commit 295ce1eb36ae47dc862d6c8a1012618a25516208 ]

Neal reported that using neper tcp_stream with TCP_TX_DELAY
set to 50ms would often lead to flows stuck in a small cwnd mode,
regardless of the congestion control.

While tcp_stream sets TCP_TX_DELAY too late after the connect(),
it highlighted two kernel bugs.

The following heuristic in tcp_tso_should_defer() seems wrong
for large RTT:

delta = tp->tcp_clock_cache - head->tstamp;
/* If next ACK is likely to come too late (half srtt), do not defer */
if ((s64)(delta - (u64)NSEC_PER_USEC * (tp->srtt_us >> 4)) < 0)
      goto send_now;

If next ACK is expected to come in more than 1 ms, we should
not defer because we prefer a smooth ACK clocking.

While blamed commit was a step in the good direction, it was not
generic enough.

Another patch fixing TCP_TX_DELAY for established flows
will be proposed when net-next reopens.

Fixes: 50c8339e9299 ("tcp: tso: restore IW10 after TSO autosizing")
