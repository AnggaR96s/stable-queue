Subject: gfs2: Improve mmap write vs. punch_hole consistency

From: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruenba@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 39c3a948ecf6e7b8f55f0e91a5febc924fede4d7 ]

When punching a hole in a file, use filemap_write_and_wait_range to
write back any dirty pages in the range of the hole.  As a side effect,
if the hole isn't page aligned, this marks unaligned pages at the
beginning and the end of the hole read-only.  This is required when the
block size is smaller than the page size: when those pages are written
to again after the hole punching, we must make sure that page_mkwrite is
called for those pages so that the page will be fully allocated and any
blocks turned into holes from the hole punching will be reallocated.
(If a page is writably mapped, page_mkwrite won't be called.)

Fixes xfstest generic/567.
