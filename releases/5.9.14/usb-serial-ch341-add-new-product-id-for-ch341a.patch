Subject: USB: serial: ch341: add new Product ID for CH341A

From: Jan-Niklas Burfeind <kernel@aiyionpri.me>

commit 46ee4abb10a07bd8f8ce910ee6b4ae6a947d7f63 upstream.

Add PID for CH340 that's found on a ch341 based Programmer made by keeyees.
The specific device that contains the serial converter is described
here: http://www.keeyees.com/a/Products/ej/36.html

The driver works flawlessly as soon as the new PID (0x5512) is added to
it.
