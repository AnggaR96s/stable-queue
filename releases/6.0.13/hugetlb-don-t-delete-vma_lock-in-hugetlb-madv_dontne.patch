Subject: hugetlb: don't delete vma_lock in hugetlb MADV_DONTNEED processing

From: Mike Kravetz <mike.kravetz@oracle.com>

commit 04ada095dcfc4ae359418053c0be94453bdf1e84 upstream.

madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) ends up calling zap_page_range() to clear page
tables associated with the address range.  For hugetlb vmas,
zap_page_range will call __unmap_hugepage_range_final.  However,
__unmap_hugepage_range_final assumes the passed vma is about to be removed
and deletes the vma_lock to prevent pmd sharing as the vma is on the way
out.  In the case of madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) the vma remains, but the
missing vma_lock prevents pmd sharing and could potentially lead to issues
with truncation/fault races.

This issue was originally reported here [1] as a BUG triggered in
page_try_dup_anon_rmap.  Prior to the introduction of the hugetlb
vma_lock, __unmap_hugepage_range_final cleared the VM_MAYSHARE flag to
prevent pmd sharing.  Subsequent faults on this vma were confused as
VM_MAYSHARE indicates a sharable vma, but was not set so page_mapping was
not set in new pages added to the page table.  This resulted in pages that
appeared anonymous in a VM_SHARED vma and triggered the BUG.

Address issue by adding a new zap flag ZAP_FLAG_UNMAP to indicate an unmap
call from unmap_vmas().  This is used to indicate the 'final' unmapping of
a hugetlb vma.  When called via MADV_DONTNEED, this flag is not set and
the vm_lock is not deleted.

NOTE - Prior to the introduction of the huegtlb vma_lock in v6.1,  this
       issue is addressed by not clearing the VM_MAYSHARE flag when
       __unmap_hugepage_range_final is called in the MADV_DONTNEED case.
