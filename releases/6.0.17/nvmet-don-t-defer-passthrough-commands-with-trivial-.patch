Subject: nvmet: don't defer passthrough commands with trivial effects to the
 workqueue

From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

[ Upstream commit 2a459f6933e1c459bffb7cc73fd6c900edc714bd ]

Mask out the "Command Supported" and "Logical Block Content Change" bits
and only defer execution of commands that have non-trivial effects to
the workqueue for synchronous execution.  This allows to execute admin
commands asynchronously on controllers that provide a Command Supported
and Effects log page, and will keep allowing to execute Write commands
asynchronously once command effects on I/O commands are taken into
account.
