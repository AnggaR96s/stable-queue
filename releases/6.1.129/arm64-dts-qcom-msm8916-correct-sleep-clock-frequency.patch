Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit f088b921890cef28862913e5627bb2e2b5f82125 ]

The MSM8916 platform uses PM8916 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
