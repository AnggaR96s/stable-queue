Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit c375ff3b887abf376607d4769c1114c5e3b6ea72 ]

The SM8450 platform uses PMK8350 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
