Subject: ipv4: icmp: Unmask upper DSCP bits in icmp_route_lookup()

From: Ido Schimmel <idosch@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit 4805646c42e51d2fbf142864d281473ad453ad5d ]

The function is called to resolve a route for an ICMP message that is
sent in response to a situation. Based on the type of the generated ICMP
message, the function is either passed the DS field of the packet that
generated the ICMP message or a DS field that is derived from it.

Unmask the upper DSCP bits before resolving and output route via
ip_route_output_key_hash() so that in the future the lookup could be
performed according to the full DSCP value.
