Subject: ibmvnic: Inspect header requirements before using scrq direct

From: Nick Child <nnac123@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit de390657b5d6f7deb9d1d36aaf45f02ba51ec9dc ]

Previously, the TX header requirement for standard frames was ignored.
This requirement is a bitstring sent from the VIOS which maps to the
type of header information needed during TX. If no header information,
is needed then send subcrq direct can be used (which can be more
performant).

This bitstring was previously ignored for standard packets (AKA non LSO,
non CSO) due to the belief that the bitstring was over-cautionary. It
turns out that there are some configurations where the backing device
does need header information for transmission of standard packets. If
the information is not supplied then this causes continuous "Adapter
error" transport events. Therefore, this bitstring should be respected
and observed before considering the use of send subcrq direct.
