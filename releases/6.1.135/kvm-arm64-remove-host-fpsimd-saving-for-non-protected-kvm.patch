Message-ID: <20250404-stable-sve-6-1-v1-6-cd5c9eb52d49@kernel.org>

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 8eca7f6d5100b6997df4f532090bc3f7e0203bef ]

Now that the host eagerly saves its own FPSIMD/SVE/SME state,
non-protected KVM never needs to save the host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state,
and the code to do this is never used. Protected KVM still needs to
save/restore the host FPSIMD/SVE state to avoid leaking guest state to
the host (and to avoid revealing to the host whether the guest used
FPSIMD/SVE/SME), and that code needs to be retained.

Remove the unused code and data structures.

To avoid the need for a stub copy of kvm_hyp_save_fpsimd_host() in the
VHE hyp code, the nVHE/hVHE version is moved into the shared switch
header, where it is only invoked when KVM is in protected mode.
