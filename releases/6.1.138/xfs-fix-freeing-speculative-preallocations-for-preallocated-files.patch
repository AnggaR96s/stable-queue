Subject: xfs: fix freeing speculative preallocations for preallocated files
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Cc: xfs-stable@lists.linux.dev, chandan.babu@oracle.com, catherine.hoang@oracle.com, djwong@kernel.org, Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>, Chandan Babu R <chandanbabu@kernel.org>, Leah Rumancik <leah.rumancik@gmail.com>

From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

[ Upstream commit 610b29161b0aa9feb59b78dc867553274f17fb01 ]

xfs_can_free_eofblocks returns false for files that have persistent
preallocations unless the force flag is passed and there are delayed
blocks.  This means it won't free delalloc reservations for files
with persistent preallocations unless the force flag is set, and it
will also free the persistent preallocations if the force flag is
set and the file happens to have delayed allocations.

Both of these are bad, so do away with the force flag and always free
only post-EOF delayed allocations for files with the XFS_DIFLAG_PREALLOC
or APPEND flags set.
