Subject: xfs: conditionally allow FS_XFLAG_REALTIME changes if S_DAX is set

From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 8d16762047c627073955b7ed171a36addaf7b1ff ]

If a file has the S_DAX flag (aka fsdax access mode) set, we cannot
allow users to change the realtime flag unless the datadev and rtdev
both support fsdax access modes.  Even if there are no extents allocated
to the file, the setattr thread could be racing with another thread
that has already started down the write code paths.

Fixes: ba23cba9b3bdc ("fs: allow per-device dax status checking for filesystems")
