Subject: xfs: Fix xfs_flush_unmap_range() range for RT

From: John Garry <john.g.garry@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit d3b689d7c711a9f36d3e48db9eaa75784a892f4c ]

Currently xfs_flush_unmap_range() does unmap for a full RT extent range,
which we also want to ensure is clean and idle.

This code change is originally from Dave Chinner.
