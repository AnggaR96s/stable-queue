Subject: mm: add folio_expected_ref_count() for reference count calculation

From: Shivank Garg <shivankg@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 86ebd50224c0734d965843260d0dc057a9431c61 ]

Patch series " JFS: Implement migrate_folio for jfs_metapage_aops" v5.

This patchset addresses a warning that occurs during memory compaction due
to JFS's missing migrate_folio operation.  The warning was introduced by
commit 7ee3647243e5 ("migrate: Remove call to ->writepage") which added
explicit warnings when filesystem don't implement migrate_folio.

The syzbot reported following [1]:
  jfs_metapage_aops does not implement migrate_folio
  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5861 at mm/migrate.c:955 fallback_migrate_folio mm/migrate.c:953 [inline]

To fix this issue, this series implement metapage_migrate_folio() for JFS
which handles both single and multiple metapages per page configurations.

While most filesystems leverage existing migration implementations like
filemap_migrate_folio(), buffer_migrate_folio_norefs() or
buffer_migrate_folio() (which internally used folio_expected_refs()),
JFS's metapage architecture requires special handling of its private data
during migration.  To support this, this series introduce the
folio_expected_ref_count(), which calculates external references to a
folio from page/swap cache, private data, and page table mappings.

This standardized implementation replaces the previous ad-hoc
folio_expected_refs() function and enables JFS to accurately determine
whether a folio has unexpected references before attempting migration.

Implement folio_expected_ref_count() to calculate expected folio reference
counts from:
- Page/swap cache (1 per page)
- Private data (1)
- Page table mappings (1 per map)

While originally needed for page migration operations, this improved
implementation standardizes reference counting by consolidating all
refcount contributors into a single, reusable function that can benefit
any subsystem needing to detect unexpected references to folios.

The folio_expected_ref_count() returns the sum of these external
references without including any reference the caller itself might hold.
Callers comparing against the actual folio_ref_count() must account for
their own references separately.

+ * folio_expected_ref_count - calculate the expected folio refcount
+ * @folio: the folio
+ *
+ * Calculate the expected folio refcount, taking references from the pagecache,
+ * swapcache, PG_private and page table mappings into account. Useful in
+ * combination with folio_ref_count() to detect unexpected references (e.g.,
+ * GUP or other temporary references).
+ *
+ * Does currently not consider references from the LRU cache. If the folio
+ * was isolated from the LRU (which is the case during migration or split),
+ * the LRU cache does not apply.
+ *
+ * Calling this function on an unmapped folio -- !folio_mapped() -- that is
+ * locked will return a stable result.
+ *
+ * Calling this function on a mapped folio will not result in a stable result,
+ * because nothing stops additional page table mappings from coming (e.g.,
+ * fork()) or going (e.g., munmap()).
+ *
+ * Calling this function without the folio lock will also not result in a
+ * stable result: for example, the folio might get dropped from the swapcache
+ * concurrently.
+ *
+ * However, even when called without the folio lock or on a mapped folio,
+ * this function can be used to detect unexpected references early (for example,
+ * if it makes sense to even lock the folio and unmap it).
+ *
+ * The caller must add any reference (e.g., from folio_try_get()) it might be
+ * holding itself to the result.
+ *
+ * Returns the expected folio refcount.
