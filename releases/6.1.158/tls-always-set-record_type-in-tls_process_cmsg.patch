Subject: tls: always set record_type in tls_process_cmsg

From: Sabrina Dubroca <sd@queasysnail.net>

[ Upstream commit b6fe4c29bb51cf239ecf48eacf72b924565cb619 ]

When userspace wants to send a non-DATA record (via the
TLS_SET_RECORD_TYPE cmsg), we need to send any pending data from a
previous MSG_MORE send() as a separate DATA record. If that DATA record
is encrypted asynchronously, tls_handle_open_record will return
-EINPROGRESS. This is currently treated as an error by
tls_process_cmsg, and it will skip setting record_type to the correct
value, but the caller (tls_sw_sendmsg_locked) handles that return
value correctly and proceeds with sending the new message with an
incorrect record_type (DATA instead of whatever was requested in the
cmsg).

Always set record_type before handling the open record. If
tls_handle_open_record returns an error, record_type will be
ignored. If it succeeds, whether with synchronous crypto (returning 0)
or asynchronous (returning -EINPROGRESS), the caller will proceed
correctly.
