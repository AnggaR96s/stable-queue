Subject: net/mlx5: Fix memory leak in error flow of port set buffer

From: Maher Sanalla <msanalla@nvidia.com>

commit e3e01c1c15986f9531b854634eec8381e72cb605 upstream.

In the cited commit, shared buffer updates were added whenever
port buffer gets updated.

However, in case the shared buffer update fails, exiting early from
port_set_buffer() is performed without freeing previously-allocated memory.

Fix it by jumping to out label where memory is freed before returning
with error.

Fixes: a440030d8946 ("net/mlx5e: Update shared buffer along with device buffer changes")
