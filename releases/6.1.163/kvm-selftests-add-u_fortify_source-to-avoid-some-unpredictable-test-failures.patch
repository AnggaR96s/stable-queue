[ Upstream commit e396a74222654486d6ab45dca5d0c54c408b8b91 ]

Some distributions (such as Ubuntu) configure GCC so that
_FORTIFY_SOURCE is automatically enabled at -O1 or above.  This results
in some fortified version of definitions of standard library functions
are included.  While linker resolves the symbols, the fortified versions
might override the definitions in lib/string_override.c and reference to
those PLT entries in GLIBC.  This is not a problem for the code in host,
but it is a disaster for the guest code.  E.g., if build and run
x86/nested_emulation_test on Ubuntu 24.04 will encounter a L1 #PF due to
memset() reference to __memset_chk@plt.

The option -fno-builtin-memset is not helpful here, because those
fortified versions are not built-in but some definitions which are
included by header, they are for different intentions.

In order to eliminate the unpredictable behaviors may vary depending on
the linker and platform, add the "-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE" into CFLAGS to
prevent from introducing the fortified definitions.
