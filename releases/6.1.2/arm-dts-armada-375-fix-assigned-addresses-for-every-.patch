Subject: ARM: dts: armada-375: Fix assigned-addresses for every PCIe Root Port
MIME-Version: 1.0

[ Upstream commit 823956d2436f70ced74c0fe8ab99facd8abfc060 ]

BDF of resource in DT assigned-addresses property of Marvell PCIe Root Port
(PCI-to-PCI bridge) should match BDF in address part in that DT node name
as specified resource belongs to Marvell PCIe Root Port itself.
