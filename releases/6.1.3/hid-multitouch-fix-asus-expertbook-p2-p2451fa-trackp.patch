[ Upstream commit 4eab1c2fe06c98a4dff258dd64800b6986c101e9 ]

The HID descriptor of this device contains two mouse collections, one
for mouse emulation and the other for the trackpoint.

Both collections get merged and, because the first one defines X and Y,
the movemenent events reported by the trackpoint collection are
ignored.

Set the MT_CLS_WIN_8_FORCE_MULTI_INPUT class for this device to be able
to receive its reports.

This fix is similar to/based on commit 40d5bb87377a ("HID: multitouch:
enable multi-input as a quirk for some devices").
