Subject: KVM: x86: Account fastpath-only VM-Exits in vCPU stats

From: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

commit 8b703a49c9df5e74870381ad7ba9c85d8a74ed2c upstream.

Increment vcpu->stat.exits when handling a fastpath VM-Exit without
going through any part of the "slow" path.  Not bumping the exits stat
can result in wildly misleading exit counts, e.g. if the primary reason
the guest is exiting is to program the TSC deadline timer.

Fixes: 404d5d7bff0d ("KVM: X86: Introduce more exit_fastpath_completion enum values")
