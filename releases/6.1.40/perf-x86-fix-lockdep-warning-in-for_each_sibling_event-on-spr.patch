Subject: perf/x86: Fix lockdep warning in for_each_sibling_event() on SPR

From: Namhyung Kim <namhyung@kernel.org>

commit 27c68c216ee1f1b086e789a64486e6511e380b8a upstream.

On SPR, the load latency event needs an auxiliary event in the same
group to work properly.  There's a check in intel_pmu_hw_config()
for this to iterate sibling events and find a mem-loads-aux event.

The for_each_sibling_event() has a lockdep assert to make sure if it
disabled hardirq or hold leader->ctx->mutex.  This works well if the
given event has a separate leader event since perf_try_init_event()
grabs the leader->ctx->mutex to protect the sibling list.  But it can
cause a problem when the event itself is a leader since the event is
not initialized yet and there's no ctx for the event.

Actually I got a lockdep warning when I run the below command on SPR,
but I guess it could be a NULL pointer dereference.

  $ perf record -d -e cpu/mem-loads/uP true

The code path to the warning is:

  sys_perf_event_open()
    perf_event_alloc()
      perf_init_event()
        perf_try_init_event()
          x86_pmu_event_init()
            hsw_hw_config()
              intel_pmu_hw_config()
                for_each_sibling_event()
                  lockdep_assert_event_ctx()

We don't need for_each_sibling_event() when it's a standalone event.
Let's return the error code directly.
