Subject: btrfs: add missing setup of log for full commit at add_conflicting_inode()

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

commit 94cd63ae679973edeb5ea95ec25a54467c3e54c8 upstream.

When logging conflicting inodes, if we reach the maximum limit of inodes,
we return BTRFS_LOG_FORCE_COMMIT to force a transaction commit. However
we don't mark the log for full commit (with btrfs_set_log_full_commit()),
which means that once we leave the log transaction and before we commit
the transaction, some other task may sync the log, which is incomplete
as we have not logged all conflicting inodes, leading to some inconsistent
in case that log ends up being replayed.

So also call btrfs_set_log_full_commit() at add_conflicting_inode().

Fixes: e09d94c9e448 ("btrfs: log conflicting inodes without holding log mutex of the initial inode")
