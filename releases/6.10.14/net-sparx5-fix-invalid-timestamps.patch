Subject: net: sparx5: Fix invalid timestamps

From: Aakash Menon <aakash.r.menon@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 151ac45348afc5b56baa584c7cd4876addf461ff ]

Bit 270-271 are occasionally unexpectedly set by the hardware. This issue
was observed with 10G SFPs causing huge time errors (> 30ms) in PTP. Only
30 bits are needed for the nanosecond part of the timestamp, clear 2 most
significant bits before extracting timestamp from the internal frame
header.

Fixes: 70dfe25cd866 ("net: sparx5: Update extraction/injection for timestamping")
