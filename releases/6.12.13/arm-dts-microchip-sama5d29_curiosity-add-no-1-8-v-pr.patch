Subject: ARM: dts: microchip: sama5d29_curiosity: Add no-1-8-v property to
 sdmmc0 node

From: Cristian Birsan <cristian.birsan@microchip.com>

[ Upstream commit c21c23a0f2e9869676eff0d53fb89e151e14c873 ]

Add no-1-8-v property to sdmmc0 node to keep VDDSDMMC power rail at 3.3V.
This property will stop the LDO regulator from switching to 1.8V when the
MMC core detects an UHS SD Card. VDDSDMMC power rail is used by all the
SDMMC interface pins in GPIO mode (PA0 - PA13).

On this board, PA6 is used as GPIO to enable the power switch controlling
USB Vbus for the USB Host. The change is needed to fix the PA6 voltage
level to 3.3V instead of 1.8V.
