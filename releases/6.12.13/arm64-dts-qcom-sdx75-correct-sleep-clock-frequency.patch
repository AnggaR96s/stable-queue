Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sdx75: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit b8021da9ddc65fa041e12ea1e0ff2dfce5c926eb ]

The SDX75 platform uses PMK8550 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
