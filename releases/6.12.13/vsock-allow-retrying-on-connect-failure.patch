Subject: vsock: Allow retrying on connect() failure

From: Michal Luczaj <mhal@rbox.co>

[ Upstream commit aa388c72113b7458127b709bdd7d3628af26e9b4 ]

sk_err is set when a (connectible) connect() fails. Effectively, this makes
an otherwise still healthy SS_UNCONNECTED socket impossible to use for any
subsequent connection attempts.

Clear sk_err upon trying to establish a connection.
