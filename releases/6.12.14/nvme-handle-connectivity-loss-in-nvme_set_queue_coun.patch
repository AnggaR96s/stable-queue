Subject: nvme: handle connectivity loss in nvme_set_queue_count

From: Daniel Wagner <wagi@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 294b2b7516fd06a8dd82e4a6118f318ec521e706 ]

When the set feature attempts fails with any NVME status code set in
nvme_set_queue_count, the function still report success. Though the
numbers of queues set to 0. This is done to support controllers in
degraded state (the admin queue is still up and running but no IO
queues).

Though there is an exception. When nvme_set_features reports an host
path error, nvme_set_queue_count should propagate this error as the
connectivity is lost, which means also the admin queue is not working
anymore.

Fixes: 9a0be7abb62f ("nvme: refactor set_queue_count")
