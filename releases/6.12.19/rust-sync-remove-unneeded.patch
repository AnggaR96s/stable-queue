commit 5e7c9b84ad08cc7a41b2ddbbbaccb60057da3860 upstream.

Rust 1.58.0 (before Rust was merged into the kernel) made Clippy's
`non_send_fields_in_send_ty` lint part of the `suspicious` lint group for
a brief window of time [1] until the minor version 1.58.1 got released
a week after, where the lint was moved back to `nursery`.

By that time, we had already upgraded to that Rust version, and thus we
had `allow`ed the lint here for `CondVar`.

Nowadays, Clippy's `non_send_fields_in_send_ty` would still trigger here
if it were enabled.

Moreover, if enabled, `Lock<T, B>` and `Task` would also require an
`allow`. Therefore, it does not seem like someone is actually enabling it
(in, e.g., a custom flags build).

Finally, the lint does not appear to have had major improvements since
then [2].

Thus remove the `allow` since it is unneeded.
