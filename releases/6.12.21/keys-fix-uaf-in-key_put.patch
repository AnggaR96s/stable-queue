Subject: keys: Fix UAF in key_put()

From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

commit 75845c6c1a64483e9985302793dbf0dfa5f71e32 upstream.

Once a key's reference count has been reduced to 0, the garbage collector
thread may destroy it at any time and so key_put() is not allowed to touch
the key after that point.  The most key_put() is normally allowed to do is
to touch key_gc_work as that's a static global variable.

However, in an effort to speed up the reclamation of quota, this is now
done in key_put() once the key's usage is reduced to 0 - but now the code
is looking at the key after the deadline, which is forbidden.

Fix this by using a flag to indicate that a key can be gc'd now rather than
looking at the key's refcount in the garbage collector.

Fixes: 9578e327b2b4 ("keys: update key quotas in key_put()")
