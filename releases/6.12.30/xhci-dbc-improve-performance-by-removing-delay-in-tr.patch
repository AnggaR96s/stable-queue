 polling.

[ Upstream commit 03e3d9c2bd85cda941b3cf78e895c1498ac05c5f ]

Queue event polling work with 0 delay in case there are pending transfers
queued up. This is part 2 of a 3 part series that roughly triples dbc
performace when using adb push and pull over dbc.

Max/min push rate after patches is 210/118 MB/s, pull rate 171/133 MB/s,
tested with large files (300MB-9GB) by Łukasz Bartosik

First performance improvement patch was commit 31128e7492dc
("xhci: dbc: add dbgtty request to end of list once it completes")
