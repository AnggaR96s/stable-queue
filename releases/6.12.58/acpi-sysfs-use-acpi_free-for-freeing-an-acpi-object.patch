Subject: ACPI: sysfs: Use ACPI_FREE() for freeing an ACPI object

From: Kaushlendra Kumar <kaushlendra.kumar@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 149139ddcb99583fdec8d1eaf7dada41e5896101 ]

Since str_obj is allocated by ACPICA in acpi_evaluate_object_typed(),
it should be free with ACPI_FREE() rather than with kfree(), so use
the former instead of the latter for freeing it.
