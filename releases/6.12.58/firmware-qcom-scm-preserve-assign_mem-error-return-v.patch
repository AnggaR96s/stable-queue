Subject: firmware: qcom: scm: preserve assign_mem() error return value

From: Mukesh Ojha <mukesh.ojha@oss.qualcomm.com>

[ Upstream commit 121fcf3c871181edce0708a49d2397cedd6ad21f ]

When qcom_scm_assign_mem() fails, the error value is currently being
overwritten after it is logged, resulting in the loss of the original
error code. Fix this by retaining and returning the original error value
as intended.
