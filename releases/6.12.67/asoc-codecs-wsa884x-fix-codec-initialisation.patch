Subject: ASoC: codecs: wsa884x: fix codec initialisation

From: Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>

commit 120f3e6ff76209ee2f62a64e5e7e9d70274df42b upstream.

The soundwire update_status() callback may be called multiple times with
the same ATTACHED status but initialisation should only be done when
transitioning from UNATTACHED to ATTACHED.

Fix the inverted hw_init flag which was set to false instead of true
after initialisation which defeats its purpose and may result in
repeated unnecessary initialisation.

Similarly, the initial state of the flag was also inverted so that the
codec would only be initialised and brought out of regmap cache only
mode if its status first transitions to UNATTACHED.
