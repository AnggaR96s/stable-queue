Subject: riscv: ftrace: Add parentheses in macro definitions of make_call_t0
 and make_call_ra

From: Juhan Jin <juhan.jin@foxmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 5f1a58ed91a040d4625d854f9bb3dd4995919202 ]

This patch adds parentheses to parameters caller and callee of macros
make_call_t0 and make_call_ra. Every existing invocation of these two
macros uses a single variable for each argument, so the absence of the
parentheses seems okay. However, future invocations might use more
complex expressions as arguments. For example, a future invocation might
look like this: make_call_t0(a - b, c, call). Without parentheses in the
macro definition, the macro invocation expands to:

...
unsigned int offset = (unsigned long) c - (unsigned long) a - b;
...

which is clearly wrong.

The use of parentheses ensures arguments are correctly evaluated and
potentially saves future users of make_call_t0 and make_call_ra debugging
trouble.
