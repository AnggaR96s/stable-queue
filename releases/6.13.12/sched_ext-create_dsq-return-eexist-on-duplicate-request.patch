Subject: sched_ext: create_dsq: Return -EEXIST on duplicate request

From: Jake Hillion <jake@hillion.co.uk>

commit a8897ed8523d4c9d782e282b18005a3779c92714 upstream.

create_dsq and therefore the scx_bpf_create_dsq kfunc currently silently
ignore duplicate entries. As a sched_ext scheduler is creating each DSQ
for a different purpose this is surprising behaviour.

Replace rhashtable_insert_fast which ignores duplicates with
rhashtable_lookup_insert_fast that reports duplicates (though doesn't
return their value). The rest of the code is structured correctly and
this now returns -EEXIST.

Tested by adding an extra scx_bpf_create_dsq to scx_simple. Previously
this was ignored, now init fails with a -17 code. Also ran scx_lavd
which continued to work well.
