Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm6375: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 223382c94f1f07c475d39713e4c058401480b441 ]

The SM6375 platform uses PM6125 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.
