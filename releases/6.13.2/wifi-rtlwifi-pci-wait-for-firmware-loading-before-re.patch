Subject: wifi: rtlwifi: pci: wait for firmware loading before releasing memory

From: Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo <cascardo@igalia.com>

[ Upstream commit b59b86c5d08be7d761c04affcbcec8184738c200 ]

At probe error path, the firmware loading work may have already been
queued. In such a case, it will try to access memory allocated by the probe
function, which is about to be released. In such paths, wait for the
firmware worker to finish before releasing memory.
