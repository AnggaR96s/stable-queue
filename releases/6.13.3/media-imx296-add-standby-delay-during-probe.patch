Subject: media: imx296: Add standby delay during probe

From: Naushir Patuck <naush@raspberrypi.com>

commit 57d10bcac67707caaa542e09dee86e13ea85defc upstream.

Add a 2-5ms delay when coming out of standby and before reading the
sensor info register durning probe, as instructed by the datasheet. This
standby delay is already present when the sensor starts streaming.

During a cold-boot, reading the IMX296_SENSOR_INFO register would often
return a value of 0x0000, if this delay is not present before.
