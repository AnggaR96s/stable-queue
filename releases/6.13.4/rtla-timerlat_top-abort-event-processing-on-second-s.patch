Subject: rtla/timerlat_top: Abort event processing on second signal

From: Tomas Glozar <tglozar@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 80967b354a76b360943af384c10d807d98bea5c4 ]

If either SIGINT is received twice, or after a SIGALRM (that is, after
timerlat was supposed to stop), abort processing events currently left
in the tracefs buffer and exit immediately.

This allows the user to exit rtla without waiting for processing all
events, should that take longer than wanted, at the cost of not
processing all samples.
