Subject: ARM: dts: omap4-panda-a4: Add missing model and compatible properties

From: Tom Rini <trini@konsulko.com>

[ Upstream commit ea07a4775df03852c353514b5b7646a17bd425be ]

When moving the model and compatible properties out of the common
Pandaboard files and in to the specific boards, the omap4-panda-a4
file wasn't updated as well and so has lacked a model and compatible
entry ever since.
