Subject: wifi: ath12k: Fix pdev lookup in WBM error processing

From: Rameshkumar Sundaram <quic_ramess@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 4e635b81db9d69bbb836afae8cb402978ff966a4 ]

Currently in ath12k_dp_rx_process_wbm_err(), when processing packets
received on the WBM error ring, pdev validation is done based upon the
hw_link_id. But hw_link_id corresponds to link id of a given partner pdev
in a MLO hardware group, and is not the correct index to use to lookup a
pdev in an SoC(ab). As a result, pdev validation fails, and the reaped
packets are dropped instead of being processed.

The correct index to use is the pdev_id, which is already derived in the
function. So update the logic to validate the pdev based upon the pdev_id
instead of the hw_link_id. This matches the logic used in other Rx ring
processing functions.

Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
Tested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3
