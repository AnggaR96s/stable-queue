Subject: mm/compaction: fix bug in hugetlb handling pathway

From: Vishal Moola (Oracle) <vishal.moola@gmail.com>

commit a84edd52f0a0fa193f0f685769939cf84510755b upstream.

The compaction code doesn't take references on pages until we're certain
we should attempt to handle it.

In the hugetlb case, isolate_or_dissolve_huge_page() may return -EBUSY
without taking a reference to the folio associated with our pfn.  If our
folio's refcount drops to 0, compound_nr() becomes unpredictable, making
low_pfn and nr_scanned unreliable.  The user-visible effect is minimal -
this should rarely happen (if ever).

Fix this by storing the folio statistics earlier on the stack (just like
the THP and Buddy cases).

Also revert commit 66fe1cf7f581 ("mm: compaction: use helper compound_nr
in isolate_migratepages_block") to make backporting easier.
