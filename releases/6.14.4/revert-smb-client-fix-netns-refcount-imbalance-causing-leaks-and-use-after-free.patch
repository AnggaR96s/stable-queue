Subject: Revert "smb: client: Fix netns refcount imbalance causing leaks and use-after-free"

From: Kuniyuki Iwashima <kuniyu@amazon.com>

commit c707193a17128fae2802d10cbad7239cc57f0c95 upstream.

This reverts commit 4e7f1644f2ac6d01dc584f6301c3b1d5aac4eaef.

The commit e9f2517a3e18 ("smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock after
rmmod") is not only a bogus fix for LOCKDEP null-ptr-deref but also
introduces a real issue, TCP sockets leak, which will be explained in
detail in the next revert.

Also, CNA assigned CVE-2024-54680 to it but is rejecting it. [0]

Thus, we are reverting the commit and its follow-up commit 4e7f1644f2ac
("smb: client: Fix netns refcount imbalance causing leaks and
use-after-free").
