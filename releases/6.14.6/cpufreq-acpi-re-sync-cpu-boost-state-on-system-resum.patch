Subject: cpufreq: ACPI: Re-sync CPU boost state on system resume

[ Upstream commit 3d59224947b024c9b2aa6e149a1537d449adb828 ]

During CPU hotunplug events (such as those occurring during
suspend/resume cycles), platform firmware may modify the CPU boost
state.

If boost was disabled prior to CPU removal, it correctly remains
disabled upon re-plug. However, if firmware re-enables boost while the
CPU is offline, the CPU may return with boost enabled—even if it was
originally disabled—once it is hotplugged back in. This leads to
inconsistent behavior and violates user or kernel policy expectations.

To maintain consistency, ensure the boost state is re-synchronized with
the kernel policy when a CPU is hotplugged back in.

Note: This re-synchronization is not necessary during the initial call
to ->init() for a CPU, as the cpufreq core handles it via
cpufreq_online(). At that point, acpi_cpufreq_driver.boost_enabled is
initialized to the value returned by boost_state(0).
