Subject: ima: process_measurement() needlessly takes inode_lock() on MAY_READ

From: Frederick Lawler <fred@cloudflare.com>

[ Upstream commit 30d68cb0c37ebe2dc63aa1d46a28b9163e61caa2 ]

On IMA policy update, if a measure rule exists in the policy,
IMA_MEASURE is set for ima_policy_flags which makes the violation_check
variable always true. Coupled with a no-action on MAY_READ for a
FILE_CHECK call, we're always taking the inode_lock().

This becomes a performance problem for extremely heavy read-only workloads.
Therefore, prevent this only in the case there's no action to be taken.
