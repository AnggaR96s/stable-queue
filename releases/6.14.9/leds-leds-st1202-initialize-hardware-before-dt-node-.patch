Subject: leds: leds-st1202: Initialize hardware before DT node child
 operations

From: Manuel Fombuena <fombuena@outlook.com>

[ Upstream commit a17d9e736ddd78323e77d3066c1e86371a99023c ]

Arguably, there are more chances of errors occurring during the
initialization of the hardware, so this should complete successfully
before the devicetree node's children are initialized.

st1202_dt_init() fills the led_classdev struct.

st1202_setup() initializes the hardware. Specifically, resets the chip,
enables its phase-shift delay feature, enables the device and disables all
the LEDs channels. All that writing to registers, with no input from
st1202_dt_init().

Real-world testing corroborates that calling st1202_setup() before
st1202_dt_init() doesn't cause any issue during initialization.

Switch the order of st1202_dt_init() and st1202_setup() to ensure the
hardware is correctly initialized before the led_classdev struct is
filled.
