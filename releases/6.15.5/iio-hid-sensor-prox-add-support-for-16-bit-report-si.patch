Subject: iio: hid-sensor-prox: Add support for 16-bit report size

From: Zhang Lixu <lixu.zhang@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit ad02ca57e44e9936fca5095840fad9d4b47c5559 ]

On Intel platforms, the HID_USAGE_SENSOR_HUMAN_PROXIMITY report size is 16
bits. This patch adds support for handling 16-bit report sizes for the
HID_USAGE_SENSOR_HUMAN_PROXIMITY usage in the HID sensor proximity driver.

Previously, the driver only supported 8-bit and 32-bit report sizes. With
this change, the driver can now correctly process 16-bit proximity data,
ensuring accurate human presence detection on platforms where this report
size is used.
