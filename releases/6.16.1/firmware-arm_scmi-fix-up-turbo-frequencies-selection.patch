Subject: firmware: arm_scmi: Fix up turbo frequencies selection

From: Sibi Sankar <quic_sibis@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit ad28fc31dd702871764e9294d4f2314ad78d24a9 ]

Sustained frequency when greater than or equal to 4Ghz on 64-bit devices
currently result in marking all frequencies as turbo. Address the turbo
frequency selection bug by fixing the truncation.

Fixes: a897575e79d7 ("firmware: arm_scmi: Add support for marking certain frequencies as turbo")
