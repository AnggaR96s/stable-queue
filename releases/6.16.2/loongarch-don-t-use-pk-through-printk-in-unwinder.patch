commit 2362e8124ed21445c6886806e5deaee717629ddd upstream.

In the past %pK was preferable to %p as it would not leak raw pointer
values into the kernel log.

Since commit ad67b74d2469 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p")
the regular %p has been improved to avoid this issue.

Furthermore, restricted pointers ("%pK") were never meant to be used
through printk(). They can still unintentionally leak raw pointers or
acquire sleeping locks in atomic contexts.

Switch to the regular pointer formatting which is safer and easier to
reason about.
