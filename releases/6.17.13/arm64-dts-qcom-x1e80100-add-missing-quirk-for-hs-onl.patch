Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add missing quirk for HS only USB
 controller

From: Krishna Kurapati <krishna.kurapati@oss.qualcomm.com>

[ Upstream commit 6b3e8a5d6c88609d9ce93789524f818cca0aa485 ]

The PIPE clock is provided by the USB3 PHY, which is predictably not
connected to the HS-only controller. Add "qcom,select-utmi-as-pipe-clk"
quirk to  HS only USB controller to disable pipe clock requirement.

Fixes: 4af46b7bd66f ("arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add USB nodes")
