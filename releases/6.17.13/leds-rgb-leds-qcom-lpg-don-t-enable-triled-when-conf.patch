Subject: leds: rgb: leds-qcom-lpg: Don't enable TRILED when configuring PWM

From: Fenglin Wu <fenglin.wu@oss.qualcomm.com>

[ Upstream commit 072cd5f458d76b9e15d89ebdaea8b5cb1312eeef ]

The PWM signal from the LPG channel can be routed to PMIC GPIOs with
proper GPIO configuration, and it is not necessary to enable the
TRILED channel in that case. This also applies to the LPG channels
that mapped to TRILED channels. Additionally, enabling the TRILED
channel unnecessarily would cause a voltage increase in its power
supply. Hence remove it.
