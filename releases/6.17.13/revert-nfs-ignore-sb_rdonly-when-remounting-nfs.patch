Subject: Revert "nfs: ignore SB_RDONLY when remounting nfs"

From: Trond Myklebust <trond.myklebust@hammerspace.com>

[ Upstream commit 400fa37afbb11a601c204b72af0f0e5bc2db695c ]

This reverts commit 80c4de6ab44c14e910117a02f2f8241ffc6ec54a.

Silently ignoring the "ro" and "rw" mount options causes user confusion,
and regressions.
