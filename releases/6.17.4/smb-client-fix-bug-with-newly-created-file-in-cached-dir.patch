Subject: smb client: fix bug with newly created file in cached dir

From: Bharath SM <bharathsm@microsoft.com>

commit aa12118dbcfe659697567c9daa0eac2c71e3fd37 upstream.

Test generic/637 spotted a problem with create of a new file in a
cached directory (by the same client) could cause cases where the
new file does not show up properly in ls on that client until the
lease times out.

Fixes: 037e1bae588e ("smb: client: use ParentLeaseKey in cifs_do_create")
