Subject: LoongArch: KVM: Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_eiointc_destroy()

From: Qiang Ma <maqianga@uniontech.com>

commit 7d8553fc75aefa7ec936af0cf8443ff90b51732e upstream.

In kvm_ioctl_create_device(), kvm_device has allocated memory,
kvm_device->destroy() seems to be supposed to free its kvm_device
struct, but kvm_eiointc_destroy() is not currently doing this, that
would lead to a memory leak.

So, fix it.
