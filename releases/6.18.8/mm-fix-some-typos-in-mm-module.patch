From: "jianyun.gao" <jianyungao89@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit b6c46600bfb28b4be4e9cff7bad4f2cf357e0fb7 ]

Below are some typos in the code comments:

  intevals ==> intervals
  addesses ==> addresses
  unavaliable ==> unavailable
  facor ==> factor
  droping ==> dropping
  exlusive ==> exclusive
  decription ==> description
  confict ==> conflict
  desriptions ==> descriptions
  otherwize ==> otherwise
  vlaue ==> value
  cheching ==> checking
  exisitng ==> existing
  modifed ==> modified
  differenciate ==> differentiate
  refernece ==> reference
  permissons ==> permissions
  indepdenent ==> independent
  spliting ==> splitting

Just fix it.
