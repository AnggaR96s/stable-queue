Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: talos: Drop opp-shared from QUP OPP table

From: Viken Dadhaniya <viken.dadhaniya@oss.qualcomm.com>

[ Upstream commit dda4bdd325326dd67ae4401f4f3d35b9cf781e3f ]

QUP devices are currently marked with opp-shared in their OPP table,
causing the kernel to treat them as part of a shared OPP domain. This
leads to the qcom_geni_serial driver failing to probe with error
-EBUSY (-16).

Remove the opp-shared property to ensure the OPP framework treats the
QUP OPP table as device-specific, allowing the serial driver to probe
successfully
