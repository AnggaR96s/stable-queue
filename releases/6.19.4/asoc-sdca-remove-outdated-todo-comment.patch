Subject: ASoC: SDCA: Remove outdated todo comment

From: Charles Keepax <ckeepax@opensource.cirrus.com>

[ Upstream commit b27b57f85fe3f0eca479556ac55bc9cbd1a5685a ]

Support for -cn- properties has already been added, however the TODO
comment noting this feature was required was not removed. Remove the
now redundant comment.

Fixes: 50a479527ef01 ("ASoC: SDCA: Add support for -cn- value properties")
