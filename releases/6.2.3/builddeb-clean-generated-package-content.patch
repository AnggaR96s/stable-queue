Subject: builddeb: clean generated package content

From: Bastian Germann <bage@linutronix.de>

[ Upstream commit c9f9cf2560e40b62015c6c4a04be60f55ce5240e ]

For each binary Debian package, a directory with the package name is
created in the debian directory. Correct the generated file matches in the
package's clean target, which were renamed without adjusting the target.

Fixes: 1694e94e4f46 ("builddeb: match temporary directory name to the package name")
