Subject: fs: dlm: be sure to call dlm_send_queue_flush()

From: Alexander Aring <aahringo@redhat.com>

commit 7354fa4ef697191effedc2ae9a8293427708bbf5 upstream.

If we release a midcomms node structure, there should be nothing left
inside the dlm midcomms send queue. However, sometimes this is not true
because I believe some DLM_FIN message was not acked... if we run
into a shutdown timeout, then we should be sure there is no pending send
dlm message inside this queue when releasing midcomms node structure.
