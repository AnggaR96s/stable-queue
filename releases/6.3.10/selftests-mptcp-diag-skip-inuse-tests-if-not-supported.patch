Subject: selftests: mptcp: diag: skip inuse tests if not supported

From: Matthieu Baerts <matthieu.baerts@tessares.net>

commit dc93086aff040349b5b2a4608c71ea01286dc2cc upstream.

Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
supporting all MPTCP features.

One of them is the reporting of the MPTCP sockets being used, introduced
by commit c558246ee73e ("mptcp: add statistics for mptcp socket in use").

Similar to the parent commit, it looks like there is no good pre-check
to do here, i.e. dedicated function available in kallsyms. Instead, we
try to get info and if nothing is returned, the test is marked as
skipped.
