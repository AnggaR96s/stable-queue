commit 6b9352f3f8a1a35faf0efc1ad1807ee303467796 upstream.

I don't see a reason why we should treat the case lo < hi differently
and return 0 as period and duty_cycle. The current logic was added with
c375bcbaabdb ("pwm: meson: Read the full hardware state in
meson_pwm_get_state()"), Martin as original author doesn't remember why
it was implemented this way back then.
So let's handle it as normal use case and also remove the optimization
for lo == 0. I think the improved readability is worth it.

Fixes: c375bcbaabdb ("pwm: meson: Read the full hardware state in meson_pwm_get_state()")
