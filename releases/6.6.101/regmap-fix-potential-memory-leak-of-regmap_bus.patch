Subject: regmap: fix potential memory leak of regmap_bus

From: Abdun Nihaal <abdun.nihaal@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit c871c199accb39d0f4cb941ad0dccabfc21e9214 ]

When __regmap_init() is called from __regmap_init_i2c() and
__regmap_init_spi() (and their devm versions), the bus argument
obtained from regmap_get_i2c_bus() and regmap_get_spi_bus(), may be
allocated using kmemdup() to support quirks. In those cases, the
bus->free_on_exit field is set to true.

However, inside __regmap_init(), buf is not freed on any error path.
This could lead to a memory leak of regmap_bus when __regmap_init()
fails. Fix that by freeing bus on error path when free_on_exit is set.

Fixes: ea030ca68819 ("regmap-i2c: Set regmap max raw r/w from quirks")
