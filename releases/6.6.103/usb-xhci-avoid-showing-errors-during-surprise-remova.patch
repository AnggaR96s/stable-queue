Subject: usb: xhci: Avoid showing errors during surprise removal

From: Mario Limonciello <mario.limonciello@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 4b9c60e440525b729ac5f071e00bcee12e0a7e84 ]

When a USB4 dock is unplugged from a system it won't respond to ring
events. The PCI core handles the surprise removal event and notifies
all PCI drivers. The XHCI PCI driver sets a flag that the device is
being removed as well.

When that flag is set don't show messages in the cleanup path for
marking the controller dead.
