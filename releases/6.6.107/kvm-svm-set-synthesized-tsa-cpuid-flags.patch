Subject: KVM: SVM: Set synthesized TSA CPUID flags

From: Borislav Petkov (AMD) <bp@alien8.de>

commit f3f9deccfc68a6b7c8c1cc51e902edba23d309d4 upstream.

VERW_CLEAR is supposed to be set only by the hypervisor to denote TSA
mitigation support to a guest. SQ_NO and L1_NO are both synthesizable,
and are going to be set by hw CPUID on future machines.

So keep the kvm_cpu_cap_init_kvm_defined() invocation *and* set them
when synthesized.

This fix is stable-only.
