Subject: IB/mlx5: Fix obj_type mismatch for SRQ event subscriptions

From: Or Har-Toov <ohartoov@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit 85fe9f565d2d5af95ac2bbaa5082b8ce62b039f5 ]

Fix a bug where the driver's event subscription logic for SRQ-related
events incorrectly sets obj_type for RMP objects.

When subscribing to SRQ events, get_legacy_obj_type() did not handle
the MLX5_CMD_OP_CREATE_RMP case, which caused obj_type to be 0
(default).
This led to a mismatch between the obj_type used during subscription
(0) and the value used during notification (1, taken from the event's
type field). As a result, event mapping for SRQ objects could fail and
event notification would not be delivered correctly.

This fix adds handling for MLX5_CMD_OP_CREATE_RMP in get_legacy_obj_type,
returning MLX5_EVENT_QUEUE_TYPE_RQ so obj_type is consistent between
subscription and notification.
