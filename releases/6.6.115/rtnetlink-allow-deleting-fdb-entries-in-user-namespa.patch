Subject: rtnetlink: Allow deleting FDB entries in user namespace
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

[ Upstream commit bf29555f5bdc017bac22ca66fcb6c9f46ec8788f ]

Creating FDB entries is possible from a non-initial user namespace when
having CAP_NET_ADMIN, yet, when deleting FDB entries, processes receive
an EPERM because the capability is always checked against the initial
user namespace. This restricts the FDB management from unprivileged
containers.

Drop the netlink_capable check in rtnl_fdb_del as it was originally
dropped in c5c351088ae7 and reintroduced in 1690be63a27b without
intention.

This patch was tested using a container on GyroidOS, where it was
possible to delete FDB entries from an unprivileged user namespace and
private network namespace.

Fixes: 1690be63a27b ("bridge: Add vlan support to static neighbors")
