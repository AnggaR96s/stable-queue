Subject: xhci: dbc: enable back DbC in resume if it was enabled before suspend
MIME-Version: 1.0

commit 2bbd38fcd29670e46c0fdb9cd0e90507a8a1bf6a upstream.

DbC is currently only enabled back if it's in configured state during
suspend.

If system is suspended after DbC is enabled, but before the device is
properly enumerated by the host, then DbC would not be enabled back in
resume.

Always enable DbC back in resume if it's suspended in enabled,
connected, or configured state
