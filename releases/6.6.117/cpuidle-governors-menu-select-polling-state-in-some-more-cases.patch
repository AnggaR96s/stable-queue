[ Upstream commit db86f55bf81a3a297be05ee8775ae9a8c6e3a599 ]

A throughput regression of 11% introduced by commit 779b1a1cb13a ("cpuidle:
governors: menu: Avoid selecting states with too much latency") has been
reported and it is related to the case when the menu governor checks if
selecting a proper idle state instead of a polling one makes sense.

In particular, it is questionable to do so if the exit latency of the
idle state in question exceeds the predicted idle duration, so add a
check for that, which is sufficient to make the reported regression go
away, and update the related code comment accordingly.
