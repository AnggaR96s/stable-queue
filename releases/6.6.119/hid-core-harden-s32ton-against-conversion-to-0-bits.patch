Subject: HID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits
To: stable@vger.kernel.org

Message-ID: <20251203112318.4289-1-jetlan9@163.com>

From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

[ Upstream commit a6b87bfc2ab5bccb7ad953693c85d9062aef3fdd ]

Testing by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core gets a
shift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bit
quantity to a 0-bit quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, but
there are buggy devices and some might have a report field with size
set to zero; we shouldn't reject the report or the device just because
of that.

Instead, harden the s32ton() routine so that it returns a reasonable
result instead of crashing when it is called with the number of bits
set to 0 -- the same as what snto32() does.

[ s32ton() was moved by c653ffc28340 ("HID: stop exporting hid_snto32()").
  Minor context change fixed. ]
