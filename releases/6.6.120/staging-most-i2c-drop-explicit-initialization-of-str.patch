Subject: staging: most: i2c: Drop explicit initialization of struct
 i2c_device_id::driver_data to 0

[ Upstream commit b5b7a2c92332b6f799e81f256aed6a93a0e037fd ]

These drivers don't use the driver_data member of struct i2c_device_id,
so don't explicitly initialize this member.

This prepares putting driver_data in an anonymous union which requires
either no initialization or named designators. But it's also a nice
cleanup on its own.

While touching the initializer, also remove the comma after the sentinel
entry.
