Subject: arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: explicitly assign clock parent for TCON0

From: Vasily Khoruzhick <anarsoul@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 8715c91a836502929c637c76a26335ede8818acf ]

TCON0 seems to need a different clock parent depending on output type.
For RGB it has to be PLL-VIDEO0-2X, while for DSI it has to be PLL-MIPI,
so select it explicitly.

Video output doesn't work if incorrect clock is assigned.

On my Pinebook I manually configured PLL-VIDEO0-2X and PLL-MIPI to the same
rate, and while video output works fine with PLL-VIDEO0-2X, it doesn't
work at all (as in no picture) with PLL-MIPI.

Fixes: ca1170b69968 ("clk: sunxi-ng: a64: force select PLL_MIPI in TCON0 mux")
