Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: q[dr]u1000: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 5546604e034b6c383b65676ff8615b346897eccd ]

The Q[DR]U1000 platforms use PM8150 to provide sleep clock. According to
the documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the
sleep clock definition.
