Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: correct sleep clock frequency

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 75420e437eed69fa95d1d7c339dad86dea35319a ]

The SM8250 platform uses PM8150 to provide sleep clock. According to the
documentation, that clock has 32.7645 kHz frequency. Correct the sleep
clock definition.

Fixes: 9ff8b0591fcf ("arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: use the right clock-freqency for sleep-clk")
