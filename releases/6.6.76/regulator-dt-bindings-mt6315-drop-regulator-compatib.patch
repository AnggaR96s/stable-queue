Subject: regulator: dt-bindings: mt6315: Drop regulator-compatible property

From: Chen-Yu Tsai <wenst@chromium.org>

[ Upstream commit 08242719a8af603db54a2a79234a8fe600680105 ]

The "regulator-compatible" property has been deprecated since 2012 in
commit 13511def87b9 ("regulator: deprecate regulator-compatible DT
property"), which is so old it's not even mentioned in the converted
regulator bindings YAML file. It should not have been used for new
submissions such as the MT6315.

Drop the property from the MT6315 regulator binding and its examples.

Fixes: 977fb5b58469 ("regulator: document binding for MT6315 regulator")
Fixes: 6d435a94ba5b ("regulator: mt6315: Enforce regulator-compatible, not name")
