Subject: ibmvnic: Return error code on TX scrq flush fail

From: Nick Child <nnac123@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit 5cb431dcf8048572e9ffc6c30cdbd8832cbe502d ]

In ibmvnic_xmit() if ibmvnic_tx_scrq_flush() returns H_CLOSED then
it will inform upper level networking functions to disable tx
queues. H_CLOSED signals that the connection with the vnic server is
down and a transport event is expected to recover the device.

Previously, ibmvnic_tx_scrq_flush() was hard-coded to return success.
Therefore, the queues would remain active until ibmvnic_cleanup() is
called within do_reset().

The problem is that do_reset() depends on the RTNL lock. If several
ibmvnic devices are resetting then there can be a long wait time until
the last device can grab the lock. During this time the tx/rx queues
still appear active to upper level functions.

FYI, we do make a call to netif_carrier_off() outside the RTNL lock but
its calls to dev_deactivate() are also dependent on the RTNL lock.

As a result, large amounts of retransmissions were observed in a short
period of time, eventually leading to ETIMEOUT. This was specifically
seen with HNV devices, likely because of even more RTNL dependencies.

Therefore, ensure the return code of ibmvnic_tx_scrq_flush() is
propagated to the xmit function to allow for an earlier (and lock-less)
response to a transport event.
