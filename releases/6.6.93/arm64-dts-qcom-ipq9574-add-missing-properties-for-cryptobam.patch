Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: ipq9574: Add missing properties for cryptobam

From: Stephan Gerhold <stephan.gerhold@linaro.org>

commit b4cd966edb2deb5c75fe356191422e127445b830 upstream.

num-channels and qcom,num-ees are required for BAM nodes without clock,
because the driver cannot ensure the hardware is powered on when trying to
obtain the information from the hardware registers. Specifying the node
without these properties is unsafe and has caused early boot crashes for
other SoCs before [1, 2].

Add the missing information from the hardware registers to ensure the
driver can probe successfully without causing crashes.
