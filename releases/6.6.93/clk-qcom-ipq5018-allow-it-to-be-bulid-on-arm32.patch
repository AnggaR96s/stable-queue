Subject: clk: qcom: ipq5018: allow it to be bulid on arm32

From: Karl Chan <exxxxkc@getgoogleoff.me>

[ Upstream commit 5d02941c83997b58e8fc15390290c7c6975acaff ]

There are some ipq5018 based device's firmware only can able to boot
arm32 but the clock driver dont allow it to be compiled on arm32.
Therefore allow GCC for IPQ5018 to be selected when building ARM32
kernel
