Subject: memcg: always call cond_resched() after fn()

From: Breno Leitao <leitao@debian.org>

commit 06717a7b6c86514dbd6ab322e8083ffaa4db5712 upstream.

I am seeing soft lockup on certain machine types when a cgroup OOMs.  This
is happening because killing the process in certain machine might be very
slow, which causes the soft lockup and RCU stalls.  This happens usually
when the cgroup has MANY processes and memory.oom.group is set.

Example I am seeing in real production:

       [462012.244552] Memory cgroup out of memory: Killed process 3370438 (crosvm) ....
       ....
       [462037.318059] Memory cgroup out of memory: Killed process 4171372 (adb) ....
       [462037.348314] watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#64 stuck for 26s! [stat_manager-ag:1618982]
       ....

Quick look at why this is so slow, it seems to be related to serial flush
for certain machine types.  For all the crashes I saw, the target CPU was
at console_flush_all().

In the case above, there are thousands of processes in the cgroup, and it
is soft locking up before it reaches the 1024 limit in the code (which
would call the cond_resched()).  So, cond_resched() in 1024 blocks is not
sufficient.

Remove the counter-based conditional rescheduling logic and call
cond_resched() unconditionally after each task iteration, after fn() is
called.  This avoids the lockup independently of how slow fn() is.
