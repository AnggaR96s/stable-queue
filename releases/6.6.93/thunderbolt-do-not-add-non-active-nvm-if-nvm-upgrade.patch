Subject: thunderbolt: Do not add non-active NVM if NVM upgrade is disabled for
 retimer

From: Mika Westerberg <mika.westerberg@linux.intel.com>

[ Upstream commit ad79c278e478ca8c1a3bf8e7a0afba8f862a48a1 ]

This is only used to write a new NVM in order to upgrade the retimer
firmware. It does not make sense to expose it if upgrade is disabled.
This also makes it consistent with the router NVM upgrade.
