Subject: RDMA/cma: Fix hang when cma_netevent_callback fails to queue_work

From: Jack Morgenstein <jackm@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit 92a251c3df8ea1991cd9fe00f1ab0cfce18d7711 ]

The cited commit fixed a crash when cma_netevent_callback was called for
a cma_id while work on that id from a previous call had not yet started.
The work item was re-initialized in the second call, which corrupted the
work item currently in the work queue.

However, it left a problem when queue_work fails (because the item is
still pending in the work queue from a previous call). In this case,
cma_id_put (which is called in the work handler) is therefore not
called. This results in a userspace process hang (zombie process).

Fix this by calling cma_id_put() if queue_work fails.

Fixes: 45f5dcdd0497 ("RDMA/cma: Fix workqueue crash in cma_netevent_work_handler")
