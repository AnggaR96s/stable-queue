Subject: cifs: reset connections for all channels when reconnect requested

From: Shyam Prasad N <sprasad@microsoft.com>

commit 1f396b9bfe39aaf55ea74a7005806164b236653d upstream.

cifs_reconnect can be called with a flag to mark the session as needing
reconnect too. When this is done, we expect the connections of all
channels to be reconnected too, which is not happening today.

Without doing this, we have seen bad things happen when primary and
secondary channels are connected to different servers (in case of cloud
services like Azure Files SMB).

This change would force all connections to reconnect as well, not just
the sessions and tcons.
