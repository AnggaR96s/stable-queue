Subject: bcachefs: install fd later to avoid race with close

From: Mathias Krause <minipli@grsecurity.net>

commit dd839f31d7cd5e04f4111a219024268c6f6973f0 upstream.

Calling fd_install() makes a file reachable for userland, including the
possibility to close the file descriptor, which leads to calling its
'release' hook. If that happens before the code had a chance to bump the
reference of the newly created task struct, the release callback will
call put_task_struct() too early, leading to the premature destruction
of the kernel thread.

Avoid that race by calling fd_install() later, after all the setup is
done.
