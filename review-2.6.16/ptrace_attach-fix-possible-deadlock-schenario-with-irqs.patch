Subject: ptrace_attach: fix possible deadlock schenario with irqs

Eric Biederman points out that we can't take the task_lock while holding
tasklist_lock for writing, because another CPU that holds the task lock
might take an interrupt that then tries to take tasklist_lock for writing.

Which would be a nasty deadlock, with one CPU spinning forever in an
interrupt handler (although admittedly you need to really work at
triggering it ;)

Since the ptrace_attach() code is special and very unusual, just make it
be extra careful, and use trylock+repeat to avoid the possible deadlock.
