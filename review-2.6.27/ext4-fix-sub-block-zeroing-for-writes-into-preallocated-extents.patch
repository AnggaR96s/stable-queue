Subject: ext4: Fix sub-block zeroing for writes into preallocated extents

(cherry picked from commit 9c1ee184a30394e54165fa4c15923cabd952c106)

We need to mark the buffer_head mapping preallocated space as new
during write_begin. Otherwise we don't zero out the page cache content
properly for a partial write. This will cause file corruption with
preallocation.

Now that we mark the buffer_head new we also need to have a valid
buffer_head blocknr so that unmap_underlying_metadata() unmaps the
correct block.
