Subject: mm: keep a guard page below a grow-down stack segment

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

commit 320b2b8de12698082609ebbc1a17165727f4c893 upstream.

This is a rather minimally invasive patch to solve the problem of the
user stack growing into a memory mapped area below it.  Whenever we fill
the first page of the stack segment, expand the segment down by one
page.

Now, admittedly some odd application might _want_ the stack to grow down
into the preceding memory mapping, and so we may at some point need to
make this a process tunable (some people might also want to have more
than a single page of guarding), but let's try the minimal approach
first.

Tested with trivial application that maps a single page just below the
stack, and then starts recursing.  Without this, we will get a SIGSEGV
_after_ the stack has smashed the mapping.  With this patch, we'll get a
nice SIGBUS just as the stack touches the page just above the mapping.
