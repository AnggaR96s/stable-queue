Subject: selinux: Fix the NetLabel glue code for setsockopt()

From: Paul Moore <paul.moore@hp.com>

commit 09c50b4a52c01a1f450b8eec819089e228655bfb upstream.

At some point we (okay, I) managed to break the ability for users to use the
setsockopt() syscall to set IPv4 options when NetLabel was not active on the
socket in question.  The problem was noticed by someone trying to use the
"-R" (record route) option of ping:

 # ping -R 10.0.0.1
 ping: record route: No message of desired type

The solution is relatively simple, we catch the unlabeled socket case and
clear the error code, allowing the operation to succeed.  Please note that we
still deny users the ability to override IPv4 options on socket's which have
NetLabel labeling active; this is done to ensure the labeling remains intact.
