Subject: writeback: fix break condition

From: Federico Cuello <fedux@lugmen.org.ar>

commit 89e1219004b3657cc014521663eeef0744f1c99d upstream.

Commit dcf6a79dda5cc2a2bec183e50d829030c0972aaa ("write-back: fix
nr_to_write counter") fixed nr_to_write counter, but didn't set the break
condition properly.

If nr_to_write == 0 after being decremented it will loop one more time
before setting done = 1 and breaking the loop.
