Subject: ACPI: Use the ARB_DISABLE for the CPU which model id is less than 0x0f.

From: Zhao Yakui <yakui.zhao@intel.com>

commit 03a05ed1152944000151d57b71000de287a1eb02 upstream.

Currently, ARB_DISABLE is a NOP on all of the recent Intel platforms.
For such platforms, reduce contention on c3_lock by skipping the fake
ARB_DISABLE.

The cpu model id on one laptop is 14. If we disable ARB_DISABLE on this box,
the box can't be booted correctly. But if we still enable ARB_DISABLE on this
box, the box can be booted correctly.

So we still use the ARB_DISABLE for the cpu which mode id is less than 0x0f.
