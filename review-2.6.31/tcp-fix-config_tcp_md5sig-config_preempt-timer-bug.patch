Subject: tcp: fix CONFIG_TCP_MD5SIG + CONFIG_PREEMPT timer BUG()

From: Robert Varga <nite@hq.alert.sk>

[ Upstream commit 657e9649e745b06675aa5063c84430986cdc3afa ]

I have recently came across a preemption imbalance detected by:

<4>huh, entered ffffffff80644630 with preempt_count 00000102, exited with 00000101?
<0>------------[ cut here ]------------
<2>kernel BUG at /usr/src/linux/kernel/timer.c:664!
<0>invalid opcode: 0000 [1] PREEMPT SMP

with ffffffff80644630 being inet_twdr_hangman().

This appeared after I enabled CONFIG_TCP_MD5SIG and played with it a
bit, so I looked at what might have caused it.

One thing that struck me as strange is tcp_twsk_destructor(), as it
calls tcp_put_md5sig_pool() -- which entails a put_cpu(), causing the
detected imbalance. Found on 2.6.23.9, but 2.6.31 is affected as well,
as far as I can tell.
