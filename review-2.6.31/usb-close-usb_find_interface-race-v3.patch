Subject: USB: Close usb_find_interface race v3

From: Russ Dill <Russ.Dill@gmail.com>

commit c2d284ee04ab6f6718de2ddcf1b43160e046c41d upstream.

USB drivers that create character devices call usb_register_dev in their
probe function. This associates the usb_interface device with that minor
number and creates the character device and announces it to the world.
However, the driver's probe function is called before the new
usb_interface is added to the driver's klist_devices.

This is a problem because userspace will respond to the character device
creation announcement by opening the character device. The driver's open
function will the call usb_find_interface to find the usb_interface
associated with that minor number. usb_find_interface will walk the
driver's list of devices and find the usb_interface with the matching
minor number.

Because the announcement happens before the usb_interface is added to the
driver's klist_devices, a race condition exists. A straightforward fix
is to walk the list of devices on usb_bus_type instead since the device
is added to that list before the announcement occurs.

bus_find_device calls get_device to bump the reference count on the found
device. It is arguable that the reference count should be dropped by the
caller of usb_find_interface instead of usb_find_interface, however,
the current users of usb_find_interface do not expect this.

The original version of this patch only matched against minor number
instead of driver and minor number. This version matches against both.
