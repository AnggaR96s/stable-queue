Subject: PCI: Ensure we re-enable devices on resume

From: Matthew Garrett <mjg@redhat.com>

commit cc2893b6af5265baa1d68b17b136cffca9e40cfa upstream.

If the firmware puts a device back into D0 state at resume time, we'll
update its state in resume_noirq and thus skip the platform resume code.
Calling that code twice should be safe and we ought to avoid getting to
that point anyway, so remove the check and also allow the platform pci
code to be called for D0.

Fixes USB not being powered after resume on recent Lenovo machines.
