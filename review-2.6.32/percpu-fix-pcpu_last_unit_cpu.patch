Subject: percpu: fix pcpu_last_unit_cpu

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit 46b30ea9bc3698bc1d1e6fd726c9601d46fa0a91 upstream.

pcpu_first/last_unit_cpu are used to track which cpu has the first and
last units assigned.  This in turn is used to determine the span of a
chunk for man/unmap cache flushes and whether an address belongs to
the first chunk or not in per_cpu_ptr_to_phys().

When the number of possible CPUs isn't power of two, a chunk may
contain unassigned units towards the end of a chunk.  The logic to
determine pcpu_last_unit_cpu was incorrect when there was an unused
unit at the end of a chunk.  It failed to ignore the unused unit and
assigned the unused marker NR_CPUS to pcpu_last_unit_cpu.

This was discovered through kdump failure which was caused by
malfunctioning per_cpu_ptr_to_phys() on a kvm setup with 50 possible
CPUs by CAI Qian.
