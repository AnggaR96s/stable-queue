Subject: iwlwifi: recalculate average tpt if not current

From: Reinette Chatre <reinette.chatre@intel.com>

commit 3d79b2a9eeaa066b35c49fbb17e3156a3c482c3e upstream.

We currently have this check as a BUG_ON, which is being hit by people.
Previously it was an error with a recalculation if not current, return that
code.

The BUG_ON was introduced by:
commit 3110bef78cb4282c58245bc8fd6d95d9ccb19749
Author: Guy Cohen <guy.cohen@intel.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 9 10:54:54 2008 +0800

    iwlwifi: Added support for 3 antennas

... the portion adding the BUG_ON is reverted since we are encountering the error
and BUG_ON was created with assumption that error is not encountered.
