Subject: sched: Drop all load weight manipulation for RT tasks

From: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@stericsson.com>

commit 17bdcf949d03306b308c5fb694849cd35f119807 upstream.

Load weights are for the CFS, they do not belong in the RT task. This makes all
RT scheduling classes leave the CFS weights alone.

This fixes a real bug as well: I noticed the following phonomena: a process
elevated to SCHED_RR forks with SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK set, and the child is
indeed SCHED_OTHER, and the niceval is indeed reset to 0. However the weight
inserted by set_load_weight() remains at 0, giving the task insignificat
priority.

With this fix, the weight is reset to what the task had before being elevated
to SCHED_RR/SCHED_FIFO.
