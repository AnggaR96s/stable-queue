Subject: Revert "mfd: da9052-spi: Change read-mask to write-mask"

From: Marcus Folkesson <marcus.folkesson@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 12daa9c1954542bf98bb942fb2dadf19de79a44b ]

This reverts commit 2e3378f6c79a1b3f7855ded1ef306ea4406352ed.

Almost every register in this chip can be customized via OTP
memory. Somehow the value for R19, which decide if the flag is set
on read or write operation, seems to have been overwritten for the chip
the original patch were written for.

Revert the change to follow the default behavior.
