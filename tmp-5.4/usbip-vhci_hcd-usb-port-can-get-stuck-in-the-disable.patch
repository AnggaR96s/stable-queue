Subject: usbip:vhci_hcd USB port can get stuck in the disabled state

From: Shuah Khan <skhan@linuxfoundation.org>

[ Upstream commit 66cce9e73ec61967ed1f97f30cee79bd9a2bb7ee ]

When a remote usb device is attached to the local Virtual USB
Host Controller Root Hub port, the bound device driver may send
a port reset command.

vhci_hcd accepts port resets only when the device doesn't have
port address assigned to it. When reset happens device is in
assigned/used state and vhci_hcd rejects it leaving the port in
a stuck state.

This problem was found when a blue-tooth or xbox wireless dongle
was passed through using usbip.

A few drivers reset the port during probe including mt76 driver
specific to this bug report. Fix the problem with a change to
honor reset requests when device is in used state (VDEV_ST_USED).
